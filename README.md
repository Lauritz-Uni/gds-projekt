After that you want to create a virtual enviroment with conda. This can be done in vscode, by opening the command pallet and searching for "> Python: Select Intepreter" and then press create enviroment (or use one you have already made).

Next run
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
In a terminal window to install the required packages.

## Preprocessor

```
cargo build --release
