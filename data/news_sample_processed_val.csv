A new type of computer hardware could improve cyber security in harsh environmental conditions

Improving cyber security in harsh environments



Many people don’t worry about the security of their personal information until it’s too late. And protecting data is even more important for military personnel, whose lives could be in danger if some types of information were to get into the wrong hands. Now, one group reports in ACS Nano a new way to protect data, especially when it is subjected to extreme environmental conditions.

According to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, the financial loss from cybercrime in the U.S. was over $1.3 billion in 2016. As this number is only expected to rise in the upcoming years, the military, businesses and individuals are seeking new ways to guard their information. Traditional methods involve installing software, but that can require frequent updates and large amounts of power. As a result, experts have proposed alternative security methods based on hardware. Physical unclonable function (PUF) devices hold promise. Random physical variations occur as this type of hardware is fabricated, which creates a unique structure that is impossible to copy or clone. But current PUFs are sensitive to harsh environments, making them a bad choice for military or outside use. So Yang-Kyu Choi and colleagues wanted to make new PUF hardware that would overcome this challenge.



The researchers designed a PUF based on nano-electro mechanical switches (NEMs), which are often used in circuits and are known for their low power consumption. A nanowire in the contraption floats between two gates. As the liquid used in the fabrication process naturally evaporates, the wire bends and adheres to one of the gates. Depending on which gate the nanowire is touching, a 0 or a 1 is generated. An array of several gates and nanowires can create an unpredictable, unique code. The NEM-PUF withstood exposure to high temperatures, microwaves and high-dose radiation. In the case of a data breach, it can self-destruct, providing an additional layer of security. “Nano-electromechanical Switch Based on a Physical Unclonable Function for Highly Robust and Stable Performance in Harsh Environments”

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

An excerpt from: 15. Searching for Meaning continued. ‘The Religion of Feelings’; ‘The Religion of True-Self’. The ‘religion’ no one wants to know about! Yet the one we all need to live if we want to feel truly happy and loved.

Mary: I want you also to understand James, what you said about Marion coming to it all herself – all through her own feelings, is very important, because, it’s because of her doing that, that I’ve been able to come to you both. And even though I don’t have anything personally to do with Marion, as in we don’t speak to each other like I do with you, still I have been with her through her whole life as she’s suffered all her feeling abuse. And by her choosing to live true to herself, which means, true to her feelings, so I’ve been able to come to you and shed more of the conceptual light on it all for you both. And so has then Jesus been able to come to you as well, joining me in our revelation to you about all of this – your feeling-denial state, your evilness, your rebellion.

Sorry Mary, but I’m still coming to terms with what you said earlier in the previous post, that really we don’t need any formal religions at all, like, no churches, no priests, no religious men or women, no holy places, no nothing like any of that.

That’s right James, you don’t. You can still of course have holy places, and places of worship, prayer and meditation, but these would be places you would go to be with others, or quiet places, to long to your Mother and Father for their Divine Love. And as well, such places could simply be places you go to sharing your experiences and expressing your feelings as you seek the truth of them. However, really your whole life is your spiritual experience, you long for the Divine Love of God when you feel you want to long for it; and you long for the truth of your feelings when you feel you want to long for the truth of them; and you keep striving to express all your feelings to your partner, and ideally, out in the world if other people are also open to it – if they are understanding and sharing the same intention in life.

To imagine that one day humanity will not have such religions… that’s hard to imagine.

One day it will happen, but not for a long time, however in the mean time, as more people come to understand about the significance of their feelings and their relationship with the truth; and as they venture into doing their feeling-healing, (or soul-healing, which is inclusive of their feeling-healing, together with longing to become at-one with God through longing to the Mother and Father for Their Divine Love), then less power and control will such institutions have over the world.

We are all so heavily indoctrinated into believing so many of our bad feelings are bad and should never be expressed, god knows how we will ever change that.

He called Trump's decision ""cruel and heartless."" His comments came Monday after Trump decided to end the Temporary Protect Status for the immigrants. The move will force them to try to obtain a new legal status or leave the U.S. by September 2019, according to the website.

The Washington Post noted the Salvadorans were granted protected status after earthquakes hit their nation in 2001. Their permits had been renewed every 18-months, according to the newspaper.

""This is a cruel and heartless decision by a cruel and heartless president,"" Perez said. ""By targeting those who were driven from their homes by environmental catastrophe and violence in El Salvador, Donald Trump is tearing more working families apart — putting their lives at risk, threatening our economy, and turning his back on the values that have made America great.

190,29626,vdare.com,bias,http://www.vdare.com/posts/president-trump-slams-democrats-for-protecting-illegal-alien-criminals,"In response to the Democrats closing the government to force an amnesty for DACA and Dreamer illegals, the White House produced a video ad that correctly connects open borders with preventable crime.

The foul-mouthed criminal shown in the video is Luis Bracamontes, the Mexican who is currently being tried for murdering two California officers, Sacramento County Deputy Danny Oliver and Placer County Detective Michael David Davis Jr., shown below:

There is no question that the President takes illegal alien crime very seriously. Candidate Donald Trump highlighted the crime victims of illegal aliens, including giving them a platform at the Republican convention. In his acceptance speech for the presidency at the convention he said:

On Monday, we heard from three parents whose children were killed by illegal immigrants Mary Ann Mendoza, Sabine Durden, and Jamiel Shaw. They are just three brave representatives of many thousands. Of all my travels in this country, nothing has affected me more deeply than the time I have spent with the mothers and fathers who have lost their children to violence spilling across our border. These families have no special interests to represent them. There are no demonstrators to protest on their behalf. My opponent will never meet with them, or share in their pain. Instead, my opponent wants Sanctuary Cities. But where was sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was Sanctuary for the children of Mary Ann, Sabine and Jamiel? Where was sanctuary for all the other Americans who have been so brutally murdered, and who have suffered so horribly? These wounded American families have been alone. But they are alone no longer. Tonight, this candidate and this whole nation stand in their corner to support them, to send them our love, and to pledge in their honor that we will save countless more families from suffering the same awful fate. We are going to build a great border wall to stop illegal immigration, to stop the gangs and the violence, and to stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. I have been honored to receive the endorsement of America’s Border Patrol Agents, and will work directly with them to protect the integrity of our lawful immigration system.

Here are the parents Trump mentioned, Jamiel Shaw Sr., Mary Ann Mendoza and Sabine Durden, with pictures of their lost sons below:

President Donald Trump is working to build the wall and keep out dangerous foreigners to protect the American people.

You do not need to believe in the Holy Trinity to believe in the positive power of doing good for others. The simple act of giving without receiving is lost on many of us these days, as worries about money and success hold us back from giving to others who are in need. One congregation in Ohio was moved to action by the power of a sermon given at their church on Christmas Eve. The pastor at Grand Lake United Methodist Church in Celina, Ohio gave an emotional sermon about the importance of understanding the message of Jesus.

For many religious people the message of Jesus is to help others before yourself, to make sure the people who are suffering get the help they need to enjoy life a little bit. The sermon was really about generosity and what that can look like in our lives. Jesus lived a long time ago and he acted generously in the fashion of his time – but what would a generous act look like in our times? That was the focus of the sermon.

The potency of the sermon was not lost on the congregation, who were so moved they had to take action! After the sermon ended, the congregation decided to take an offering. A bowl was passed around the room and everyone pitched in what they could on this Christmas Eve with the words of the sermon still ringing in their ears.

What did they do with this offering? Members of the congregation drove down to the local Waffle House to visit the ladies working the night shift. What a great choice on this most holy of days when everyone should be with their families!

The ladies working at Waffle House clearly were not with their families. They had no choice but to work on this holy day because it paid the bills. The congregation understood the sacrifice being made by these ladies, and wanted to help them out. They donated the entire offering to be split amongst the ladies at Waffle House.

In total that amounted to $3,500 being split amongst the staff. What a beautiful moment! What a perfect example of what the preacher was talking about in his sermon! Doing a good deed like this on Christmas really helped ease the burden felt by the ladies working at Waffle House. Sure, they could not see their families, but at least they got a little gift from the good people of their community.

Perhaps the best part about this whole event was that the congregation did not ask anything in return. It was a simple act of generosity from people who understood the pain being felt by another group and sought to alleviate some of that pain. It speaks volumes about the merits of the Church in our daily lives. This simple act brought the entire community together because it showed empathy and compassion on the most special day of the year.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02

220,36296,breitbart.com,political,http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/26/review-plunder-and-deceit-by-mark-levin/,"Mark Levin has done the nation a great service. He wrote a new book. It’s called Plunder and Deceit: Big Government’s Exploitation of Young People and the Future.

As an investigative author, I spend my time combing through troves of data, reams of financial transactions, and stacks of inter-governmental communiqués, all in an effort to unearth fact-patterns of self-dealing and cronyism, malfeasance and graft. My work is zoomed in, specific, granular.

The conservative movement needs its sleuths. But what I love about Levin’s Plunder and Deceit is its philosophical breadth and panoramic sweep. Powered by intellectual titans like Edmund Burke, Alexis de Tocqueville, and James Madison, Levin urges young people to embark upon the creation of a “New Civil Rights movement,” one that snaps the manacles of statist power and embraces an intellectual and economic freedom that excites and animates the moral imagination.

Best of all, Levin respects young readers enough to shoot straight with them: the road to serfdom is breezy; the march to liberty painstaking. Yet, as he reminds us, the fruits of the latter far eclipse the former.

“It is the nature of younger people today to passively live and let live and conform to their second-class standing; or worse, if inspired, to unite around distractive or self-destructive causes,” writes Levin. “But the right cause now is nothing short of self-preservation. And there can be no doubt that the New Civil Rights movement and new generation of activists, which must challenge the tyranny of the status quo, will be met with entrenched resistance, resulting in unease, discomfiture, risk, and ridicule. This is a small price to pay for freedom and justice.”

Amen!

With the Constitution always as his guide, Levin explains to “the rising generation” why the nation’s founding bedrock document is precious and rare. As President Ronald Reagan put it, in the constitutions of most governments, “the government tells the people of those countries what they’re allowed to do. In our Constitution, ‘We the People’ tell the government what it can do.”

That’s a difference worth fighting for and protecting. Levin’s book shows us how.

Authentic, sagacious, and written in a philosophical tenor that sometimes soars to operatic heights, Plunder and Deceit is an important work to be read by all and bequeathed to America’s rising generation.",2018-01-25 20:13:50.426130,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,Review: ‘Plunder and Deceit’ by Mark Levin,Peter Schweizer,,"['', 'Big Government', 'mark levin']",Mark Levin has done the nation a great service.

35,5934,canadafreepress.com,conspiracy,http://canadafreepress.com/article/to-france-from-a-post-9-11-america-lessons-we-learned-too-late,"“Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.”—Hermann Goering, German military commander and Hitler’s designated successor

Here are some of the lessons we in the United States learned too late about allowing our freedoms to be eviscerated in exchange for the phantom promise of security.

What remains to be seen is whether France, standing where the United States did 14 years ago, will follow in America’s footsteps as she grapples with the best way to shore up her defenses, where to draw the delicate line in balancing security with liberty, and what it means to secure justice for those whose lives were taken.

Once again, there is that same sense of shock. The same shocking images of carnage and grief dominating the news. The same disbelief that anyone could be so hateful, so monstrous, so evil as to do this to another human being. The same outpourings of support and unity from around the world. The same shared fear that this could easily have happened to us or our loved ones.

Beware of mammoth legislation that expands the government’s powers at the citizenry’s expense. Rushed through Congress a mere 45 days after the 9/11 attacks, the USA Patriot Act drove a stake through the heart of the Bill of Rights, undermined civil liberties, expanded the government’s powers and opened the door to far-reaching surveillance by the government on American citizens.

Pre-emptive strikes will only lead to further blowback. Not content to wage war against Afghanistan, which served as the base for Osama bin Laden, the U.S. embarked on a pre-emptive war against Iraq in order to “stop any adversary challenging America’s military superiority and adopt a strike-first policy against terrorist threats ‘before they're fully formed.’” We are still suffering the consequences of this failed policy, which has resulted in lives lost, taxpayer dollars wasted, the fomenting of hatred against the U.S. and the further radicalization of terrorist cells.

War is costly. There are many reasons to go to war, but those who have advocated that the U.S. remain at war, year after year, are the very entities that have profited most from these endless military occupations and exercises. Thus far, the U.S. taxpayer has been made to shell out more than $1.6 trillion on “military operations, the training of security forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, weapons maintenance, base support, reconstruction, embassy maintenance, foreign aid, and veterans’ medical care, as well as war-related intelligence operations not tracked by the Pentagon” since 2001. Other estimates that account for war-related spending, veterans’ benefits and various promissory notes place that figure closer to $4.4 trillion. That also does not include the more than 210,000 civilians killed so far, or the 7.6 million refugees displaced from their homes as a result of the endless drone strikes and violence.

Advocating torture makes you no better than terrorists. The horrors that took place at Abu Ghraib, the American-run prison in Iraq, continue to shock those with any decency. Photographs leaked to the media depicted “US military personnel humiliating, hurting and abusing Iraqi prisoners in a myriad of perverse ways. While American servicemen and women smiled and gave thumbs up, naked men were threatened by dogs, or were hooded, forced into sexual positions, placed standing with wires attached to their bodies, or left bleeding on prison floors.” Adding to the descent into moral depravity, the United States government legalized the use of torture, including waterboarding, in violation of international law and continues to sanction human rights violations in the pursuit of national security. The ramifications have been far-reaching, with local police now employing similar torture tactics at secret locations such as Homan Square in Chicago.

Allowing the government to spy on the citizenry will not reduce acts of terrorism, but it will result in a watched, submissive, surveillance society. A byproduct of this post 9/11-age in which we live, whether you’re walking through a store, driving your car, checking email, or talking to friends and family on the phone, you can be sure that some government agency, whether the NSA or some other entity, is listening in and tracking your behavior. This doesn’t even begin to touch on the corporate trackers such as Google that monitor your purchases, web browsing, Facebook posts and other activities taking place in the cyber sphere. We are all becoming data collected in government files. The chilling effect of this endless surveillance is a more anxious and submissive citizenry.

Don’t become so distracted by the news cycle that you lose sight of what the government is doing. The average American has a hard time keeping up with and remembering all of the “events,” manufactured or otherwise, which occur like clockwork and keep us distracted, deluded, amused, and insulated from the reality of the American police state. Whether these events are critical or unimportant, when we’re being bombarded with wall-to-wall news coverage and news cycles that change every few days, it’s difficult to stay focused on one thing—namely, holding the government accountable to abiding by the rule of law—and the powers-that-be understand this. In this way, regularly scheduled trivia and/or distractions that keep the citizenry tuned into the various breaking news headlines and entertainment spectacles also keep them tuned out to the government’s steady encroachments on their freedoms.

If you stop holding the government accountable to the rule of law, the only laws it abides by will be the ones used to clamp down on the citizenry. Having failed to hold government officials accountable to abiding by the rule of law, the American people have found themselves saddled with a government that skirts, flouts and violates the Constitution with little consequence. Overcriminalization, asset forfeiture schemes, police brutality, profit-driven prisons, warrantless surveillance, SWAT team raids, indefinite detentions, covert agencies, and secret courts are just a few of the egregious practices carried out by a government that operates beyond the reach of the law.

Do not turn your country into a battlefield, your citizens into enemy combatants, and your law enforcement officers into extensions of the military. A standing army—something that propelled the early colonists into revolution—strips the citizenry of any vestige of freedom. How can there be any semblance of freedom when there are tanks in the streets, military encampments in cities, Blackhawk helicopters and armed drones patrolling overhead? It was for this reason that those who established America vested control of the military in a civilian government, with a civilian commander-in-chief. They did not want a military government, ruled by force. Rather, they opted for a republic bound by the rule of law: the U.S. Constitution. Unfortunately, we in America now find ourselves struggling to retain some semblance of freedom in the face of police and law enforcement agencies that look and act like the military and have just as little regard for the Fourth Amendment, laws such as the NDAA that allow the military to arrest and indefinitely detain American citizens, and military drills that acclimate the American people to the sight of armored tanks in the streets, military encampments in cities, and combat aircraft patrolling overhead.

As long as you remain fearful and distrustful of each other, you will be incapable of standing united against any threats posed by a power-hungry government. Early on, U.S. officials solved the problem of how to implement their authoritarian policies without incurring a citizen uprising: fear. The powers-that-be want us to feel threatened by forces beyond our control (terrorists, shooters, bombers). They want us afraid and dependent on the government and its militarized armies for our safety and well-being. Most of all, they want us distrustful of each other, divided by our prejudices, and at each other’s throats.

If you trade your freedom for security, the terrorists win. We’ve walked a strange and harrowing road since September 11, 2001, littered with the debris of our once-vaunted liberties. We have gone from a nation that took great pride in being a model of a representative democracy to being a model of how to persuade a freedom-loving people to march in lockstep with a police state. And in so doing, we have proven Osama Bin Laden right. He warned that “freedom and human rights in America are doomed. The U.S. government will lead the American people in — and the West in general — into an unbearable hell and a choking life.”

To sum things up, the destruction that began with the 9/11 terror attacks has expanded into an all-out campaign of terror, trauma, acclimation and indoctrination aimed at getting Americans used to life in the American Police State. The bogeyman’s names and faces change over time, but the end result remains the same: our unquestioning acquiescence to anything the government wants to do in exchange for the phantom promise of safety and security has transitioned us to life in a society where government agents routinely practice violence on the citizens while, in conjunction with the Corporate State, spying on the most intimate details of our personal lives.

The lesson learned, as I document in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, is simply this: once you start down the road towards a police state, it will be very difficult to turn back.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,To France from a Post-9/11 America: Lessons We Learned Too Late,"John W.

age in which we live whether youre walking through a store driving your car checking email or talking to friends and family on the phone you can be sure that some government agency whether the nsa or some other entity is listening in and tracking your behavior this doesnt even begin to touch on the corporate trackers such as google that monitor your purchases web browsing facebook posts and other activities taking place in the cyber sphere we are all becoming data collected in government files the chilling effect of this endless surveillance is a more anxious and submissive citizenry dont become so distracted by the news cycle that you lose sight of what the government is doing the average american has a hard time keeping up with and remembering all of the events manufactured or otherwise which occur like clockwork and keep us distracted deluded amused and insulated from the reality of the american police state whether these events are critical or unimportant when were being bombarded with walltowall news coverage and news cycles that change every few days its difficult to stay focused on one thingnamely holding the government accountable to abiding by the rule of lawand the powersthatbe understand this in this way regularly scheduled trivia and/or distractions that keep the citizenry tuned into the various breaking news headlines and entertainment spectacles also keep them tuned out to the governments steady encroachments on their freedoms if you stop holding the government accountable to the rule of law the only laws it abides by will be the ones used to clamp down on the citizenry having failed to hold government officials accountable to abiding by the rule of law the american people have found themselves saddled with a government that skirts flouts and violates the constitution with little consequence overcriminalization asset forfeiture schemes police brutality profitdriven prisons warrantless surveillance swat team raids indefinite detentions covert agencies and secret courts are just a few of the egregious practices carried out by a government that operates beyond the reach of the law do not turn your country into a battlefield your citizens into enemy combatants and your law enforcement officers into extensions of the military a standing armysomething that propelled the early colonists into revolutionstrips the citizenry of any vestige of freedom how can there be any semblance of freedom when there are tanks in the streets military encampments in cities blackhawk helicopters and armed drones patrolling overhead it was for this reason that those who established america vested control of the military in a civilian government with a civilian commanderinchief they did not want a military government ruled by force rather they opted for a republic bound by the rule of law the us constitution unfortunately we in america now find ourselves struggling to retain some semblance of freedom in the face of police and law enforcement agencies that look and act like the military and have just as little regard for the fourth amendment laws such as the ndaa that allow the military to arrest and indefinitely detain american citizens and military drills that acclimate the american people to the sight of armored tanks in the streets military encampments in cities and combat aircraft patrolling overhead as long as you remain fearful and distrustful of each other you will be incapable of standing united against any threats posed by a powerhungry government early on us officials solved the problem of how to implement their authoritarian policies without incurring a citizen uprising fear the powersthatbe want us to feel threatened by forces beyond our control terrorists shooters bombers they want us afraid and dependent on the government and its militarized armies for our safety and wellbeing most of all they want us distrustful of each other divided by our prejudices and at each others throats

Top Hurricane Matthew Aftermath Footage 2016 – Mainstream Media Isn’t Telling You The Truth!

(CNN)Hurricane Matthew was leaving behind record-breaking flooding Saturday as the center of the storm moved out into the Atlantic Ocean, dragging bands of heavy rain with it across eastern North Carolina.

The Category 1 hurricane was dropping 8 to 20 inches of rain in the Tar Heel State and southeast Virginia.

“This rainfall is leading to record-breaking flooding over portions of eastern North Carolina, and it may result in life-threatening flooding and flash flooding elsewhere across the region,” the National Hurricane Center said.

The hurricane left swaths of damage and millions of power outages along parts of the US Southeast from Florida to the Carolinas after a destructive trip through the Caribbean that took the lives of hundreds of people.

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Sir, Tim Harford, who has blocked me on Twitter writes: “Bank of England’s unofficial blog…compared plunging productivity with the soaring shipments of smartphones. Typical productivity growth in advanced economies had hovered steadily around 1 per cent a year for several decades, but has on average been negative since 2007. That was the year the iPhone started to ship.” “ Computers are making generalists of us all ”, December 6.

That iPhone and many of its close or distant cousins, cause a lot of distractions. If that time distracted was classified not as time of production but as time of consumption, and outputs remain fairly the same, would that not point at much higher productivity and much higher real salaries?

PS. Harford writes here also a lot about Power Point presentations. Here my long ago take on it

Astro-imager Damian Peach reprocessed one of the latest images taken by Juno’s JunoCam during its 3rd close flyby of the planet on Dec. 11. The photo highlights one of the large ‘pearls’ (right) that forms a string of storms in Jupiter’s atmosphere. A smaller isolated storm is seen at left. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS

Jupiter looks beautiful in pearls! This image, taken by the JunoCam imager on NASA’s Juno spacecraft, highlights one of the eight massive storms that from a distance form a ‘string of pearls’ on Jupiter’s turbulent atmosphere. They’re counterclockwise rotating storms that appear as white ovals in the gas giant’s southern hemisphere. The larger pearl in the photo above is roughly half the size of Earth. Since 1986, these white ovals have varied in number from six to nine with eight currently visible.

Four more ‘pearls’ photographed on Dec. 10, 2016 in the planet’s South Temperate Belt below the Great Red Spot. The moon Ganymede is at left. The show up well in photos but require good seeing and at least and 8-inch telescope to see visually. Credit: Christopher Go

The photos were taken during Sunday’s close flyby. At the time of closest approach — called perijove — Juno streaked about 2,580 miles (4,150 km) above the gas giant’s roiling, psychedelic cloud tops traveling about 129,000 mph or nearly 60 km per second relative to the planet. Seven of Juno’s eight science instruments collected data during the flyby. At the time the photos were taken, the spacecraft was about 15,300 miles (24,600 km) from the planet.

This is the original image sent by JunoCam on Dec. 11 and features the eighth in a string of large storms in the planet’s southern hemisphere. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS

JunoCam is a color, visible-light camera designed to capture remarkable pictures of Jupiter’s poles and cloud tops. As Juno’s eyes, it will provide a wide view, helping to provide context for the spacecraft’s other instruments. JunoCam was included on the spacecraft specifically for purposes of public engagement; although its images will be helpful to the science team, it is not considered one of the mission’s science instruments.

4-frame animation spans 24 Jovian days, or about 10 Earth days. The passage of time is accelerated by a factor of 600,000. Some of the ovals are visible as well as a variety of jets – west to east and east to west. Credit: NASA

The crazy swirls of clouds we see in the photos are composed of ammonia ice crystals organized into a dozen or so bands parallel to the equator called belts (the darker ones) and zones. The border of each is bounded by a powerful wind flow called a jet, resembling Earth’s jet streams, which alternate direction from one band to the next.

Zones are colder and mark latitudes where material is upwelling from below. Ammonia ice is thought to give the zones their lighter color. Belts in contrast indicate sinking material; their color is a bit mysterious and may be due to the presence of hydrocarbons — molecules that are made from hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen as well as exotic sulfur and phosphorus compounds.

Use this guide to help you better understand Jupiter’s arrangement of belts and zones, many of which are visible in amateur telescopes. Credit: NASA/JPL/Wikipedia

The pearls or storms form in windy Jovian atmosphere and can last many decades. Some eventually dissipate while others merge to form even larger storms. Unlike hurricanes, which fall apart when they blow inland from the ocean, there’s no “land” on Jupiter, so storms that get started there just keep on going. The biggest, the Great Red Spot, has been hanging around causing trouble and delight (for telescopic observers) for at least 350 years.

Juno’s next perijove pass will happen on Feb. 2, 2017.

Auto insurance rates skyrocket nationwide

Thanks to lower gas prices, more drivers are hitting the road this summer. But more drivers leads to more accidents, which results in higher insurance rates for everyone. April's 6 percent jump was the biggest the nation has seen since 2003.

""Unfortunately, out on our roadways, we're seeing a collision course of all the factors that affect what we pay for car insurance,"" Carole Walker, executive director of the Rocky Mountain Insurance Information Association, told Legal Reader.

The National Safety Council said 2015 was the deadliest year since 2008, with 38,300 deaths. The NSC reported that 4.4 million people were seriously injured.

Nearly every state is feeling the burden and ""good"" drivers are not exempt from rate hikes, Walker said.

Auto insurer Allstate recorded one of the biggest rate increases so far in Georgia, where prices went up by an average of 25 percent, while traffic fatalities in the state increased 21 percent.

In recent years, insurance companies have experienced a decline in profits. From 2005-13, the average payout for bodily injury claims rose 32 percent, according to the Insurance Research Council.

Avoiding moving violations and at-fault accidents are the most effective ways to lower costs, Walker said. Drivers also can ask insurance agents about other ways to save.

""Can I be a better driver? Can I take a defensive driving class? What kind of car do I drive? Is it more crash-worthy?"" Walker said. ""That will also offer you discounts on what you pay."" — Joana Suleiman

FOOD SAFETY

GAO to FDA: Improve tool for assessing imported food risk

After looking at the Food and Drug Administration's food import data from 2012-14, the Government Accountability Office found that PREDICT, the agency's computerized risk assessment tool, could be more effective.

Since the FDA can only physically examine about 1 percent of all the imported food coming into the United States each year, computer tools such as PREDICT are more important than ever.

""PREDICT improves import screening and targeting to prevent entry of adulterated, misbranded or otherwise violative goods, expedites the entry of non-violative goods. PREDICT uses automated data mining, pattern discovery and automated queries of FDA databases to determine the potential risk of a shipment for examination. It also expedites the clearance of lower-risk cargo, but only if accurate and complete data are provided by importers and entry filers,"" the FDA explained after it rolled out the system.

GAO analysts noted that PREDICT was pretty good at flagging for physical examination those imported food items at higher risk of violating either safety regulations or labeling rules. However, there were two things the FDA could do to make PREDICT even more useful. One is to set up a documentation process to identify those open-source data, acquire these data and then determine how PREDICT should use them.

Furthermore, new rules and programs set up under the Food Safety Modernization Act will result in more information for PREDICT to use in helping to assess food safety of imported goods, the GAO reported. — Joana Suleiman

FERC kicks Berkshire out of the market

Billionaire Warren Buffett's holding company is getting booted from participating in the wholesale electric market because it couldn't convince federal regulators that 20 of its power companies aren't a monopoly.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued the order banning 20 of Berkshire Hathway's affiliate energy firms from selling energy until it can prove that the companies do not constitute a monopoly.

The commission said the company's analysis was flawed, saying the constitution of Bershire's market-based rate authority to sell power ""is not just and reasonable,"" and revoked its license to sell power.

""The commission provided the Berkshire MBR Sellers ample opportunity to correct their [analysis and market power modeling] consistent with the commission's regulations,"" FERC said. But in the end, ""FERC revoked market-based rate authority for 20 BHE entities operating in the PacifiCorp-East, PacifiCorp-West, Idaho Power and NorthWestern balancing authority areas.""

However, the commission found that Berkshire Hathaway entities operating in the Arizona Public Service, Bonneville Power Administration, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, Western Area Power Administration-Colorado Missouri and Western Area Power Administration-Lower Colorado balancing authority areas, and the California grid operator's markets were not monopolies. — John Siciliano

Robots to farm the earth

The Energy Department is putting money into building robotic farmers to raise and produce bioenergy crops for producing clean-burning fuels.

The agency's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E, is bringing together experts on plant genetics, information technology and robotics in the search for bioenergy crops that are sustainable, affordable and can yield abundant crops for biofuel.

The project is called TERRA, or ""Transportation Energy Resources from Renewable Agriculture,"" and features researchers ""building robots armed with cutting-edge sensors to collect data on plant characteristics"" to improve the harvest of biofuels.

""Meanwhile, other teams develop tools that use this data to predict which plants will grow more quickly, thrive in stressful environments and generally show greater potential to fuel and feed our planet,"" the agency says.

Already built is a robot called the ""Scanalyzer,"" which combines a small ground-based droid with an airborne drone to monitor field production.

The information gathered by the device ""could give farmers valuable insight into which plants are more resilient in the Arizona desert — which, in turn, could have a transformational impact on the future of global energy and food security."" — John Siciliano

EDUCATION

Teachers play role in decline of interracial friendships

According to a study published in the Journal of Early Adolescence, teachers are part of the reason why interracial friendships among students decline during the school year.

""Same-race friendships increase over time, with greater increases among European-Americans and older children,"" researchers said. When the school year began in third grade, white students had 2 percent more white friends than would be expected by random chance, increasing to 6 percent more at the end of the year. In fifth grade, the increase for white students was from 23 percent more to 33 percent more.

Previous research had already established similar conclusions, so this study sought to find out why that was occurring. In classrooms where students said teachers cared about their feelings, students were more likely to maintain interracial friendships. In classrooms where teachers paid less attention to students' feelings and had less respect for students, same-race friendships were more likely to form.

Researchers looked at data from the 1996-97 school year, with 553 students in 53 classrooms, ranging from third grade to fifth grade. The study was authored by Elise Cappella and Diane Hughes, with New York University, and Meghan McCormick, with MDRC, a nonprofit social policy research organization. — Jason Russell

HEALTH

Progress stalled on state-level smoking

Progress by states to curb smoking has stalled, as a new report found that only a small number of states have enacted smoking bans or raised taxes on cigarettes recently.

The report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at state anti-smoking laws from 2000-14. It found that from 2000-09, 21 states and the District of Columbia implemented smoke-free laws prohibiting smoking in restaurants, bars and work sites. However, from 2010-14, only five states passed such bans, bringing the total to 26 states.

In addition, fewer than one-third of U.S. states have raised their excise tax on cigarettes in recent years.

From 2000-09, 46 states and the District of Columbia increased their cigarette tax by 92 cents. From 2010-14, only 14 states plus D.C. increased their excise tax and only by an average 20 cents.

The CDC lamented the lack of progress on the state laws, saying that it may ""undermine tobacco prevention and control efforts in the United States, undercutting efforts to reduce tobacco use, exposure to secondhand smoke, health disparities and tobacco-related illness and death."" — Robert King",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,POLICY

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

It’s no secret that the startup funding world is going to change quite a bit over the course of the year. Most of the startups that IPO’ed in 2015 are seeing lower-than-expected share prices, valuations have dropped, and some have declared that the sky is falling.

While I don’t think the sky is falling, I do think valuations got out of control, and some market correction is going to happen this year, and yes this will impact startups, and investors, all over the world. We’re lucky to live at a time where so many venture capitalists have blogs and share their opinions on what’s happening in the market.

Here are three blog posts I recommend taking a look at if you’re a startup founder trying to understand what the fundraising landscape looks like in 2016.

I think 2016 is going to be an incredible year for startups, major milestones will be hit, teams will be built, and investments will happen. That being said, there’s no denying that the landscape will change this year, the question is – how will you react to this change?

Federal officials announced the largest-ever seizure of bitcoins on Friday night, securing $28 million worth of the digital currency from the alleged owner of the online drug marketplace Silk Road.

Bitcoin, which allows users to conduct online transactions while obscuring their identities, was the only currency accepted on Silk Road. Law enforcement officials arrested the site’s alleged proprietor, Ross Ulbricht, earlier this month, and have shuttered the operation.

Ulbricht faces a potentially lengthy prison sentence for charges ranging from narcotics trafficking to computer hacking to money laundering. Federal officials have now seized over $33.6 million worth of bitcoins in connection with the case.

Mike Gleason: It is my privilege now to welcome in Greg Weldon, CEO and President of Weldon Financial. Greg has over three decades of market research and trading experience, specializing in metals and commodity markets and even authored a book in 2006 titled Gold Trading Bootcamp, where he accurately predicted the implosion of the U.S. credit market and urged people to buy gold when it was only $550 an ounce.

He is a highly sought-after presenter at financial conferences throughout the country, and is a regular guest on financial shows throughout the world, and it’s good to have him back here on the Money Metals Podcast.

Greg, thanks for joining us today. And it’s nice to talk to you again. How are you?

Greg Weldon: I’m great, thanks. My pleasure, Micheal.

Mike Gleason: Well, when we had you on back in mid-August you were optimistic about gold at the time. We had a pretty good move higher, shortly thereafter that ended up with gold hitting a one year high. But it stalled out around $1,350 in early September and we’re currently back below $1,300 as we’re talking here on Wednesday afternoon. Gold hit resistance at about the same level in the summer of last year, so give us your update as to your current outlook. What drivers, if any, do you see that can push gold through that $1,350 resistance level in the months ahead, Greg?

Greg Weldon: Yeah, well, exactly as you said. You had the move that we were anticipating when we last spoke and it kind of had already started from the 1205-ish level. All of this fitting into the kind of bigger picture, technical structure that still leads to a bullish resolution. But as you accurately mentioned, you got up to what have been close to, not quite even towards last summer’s highs around $1,375, $1,377. In this case, around $1,360 and ran out of steam.

The dollar kind of changed some of the picture and the thought process linked to the Fed changed some of the picture. So, you embarked on a downside correction. $1,260 was the low, you have a nice little correction from that level. That was the level that equated to 200-day exponential moving average. It’s a level that was just below the 38% Fibonnaci retracement of the move up from $1,205. Actually, the move up from $1,123 back at the end of 2016. So you had real, critical support there. So, to me, everything’s kind of mapped out the way you might expect it to, structurally, in this market.

From here, one of two things happens, I think. Well, one of three things, anyway. You could be cut if you have a bit of low rally backed up to $1,300. You back below it a little bit to dollars; still looks kind of strong. It’s an interest rate differential dynamic as a more hawkish view for the Fed is priced into the Fed funds; that gets transferred into the two-year and five-year treasury notes. The two-year treasury notes at a record high-yield relative to the German two-year schatzi. So, that lifting the dollar … it’s kind of gravitational pull to the upside. And that is some of the downside risk here; that the rally we just saw is kind of you b-wave and maybe you have a c-wave down towards $1,240. That’s kind of an ultimate low. Whether or not it plays out that way, longer term we still like it.

Mike Gleason: Precious metals have had a pretty respectable year all in all. Gold is up about 11% year to date. Silver is up about half as much. There isn’t exactly a lot of excitement. It seems like it’s always two steps forward, one step back. Sentiment in the physical bullion markets, where we operate, is muted. There are multiple factors to consider as to why metals markets are stuck in a bit of a rut. It seems to us that one of the big ones is the equities market stock prices just keep marching relentlessly higher. Either investors have become totally desensitized to risk or maybe there just isn’t as much risk as well think there is. In any event, barring some sort of spike in inflation expectations, which pushes metals and stocks both higher, we don’t see gold and silver breaking out unless investors start getting nervous about stock market valuations and thinking about safe havens. So what are your thoughts about equity markets and how they relate to precious metals, Greg? And where do you see stock prices headed in the near term?

Greg Weldon: Yeah, I mean it’s a perfect question because the reality is, and we in our daily research we focused on this, in fact yesterday. We haven’t spoken … It sounds like we arranged this question. Focusing on the fact that gold, relative to S&P, is at a low. You really are kind of lows that we’ve seen before, but at a level where if you get much lower, you’re breaking down to multi-year lows and this whole thing gets called into question from a technical perspective. But my problem with looking at it from a technical perspective, is that I think the stock market is living in borrowed times. Basically, the Fed has done exactly what they wanted to do. They have flushed people out of safe havens and into risk assets. That’s the whole idea of QE. It worked. You reflated the stock market. That has facilitated a huge, unprecedented rise in consumer credit.

Instead of the housing market being the collateral like it was in 2006 and 2007, now it’s the stock market that’s the collateral, the Googles and Amazons of the world and the Facebooks of the world. And you have this demand that is being driven or really being fed by credit. Now you see the credit numbers start to slow. They’re unsustainable. You start to see the consumer roll over a little bit. So that’s the number one risk to the stock market; it’s actually the consumer.

If you look at the retail sales numbers, outside of automobiles and gasoline, which is price-based, you don’t have much of anything. And you have eating and drinking growth slowing. That’s a key component, a key layer to the discretionary spending that’s an important tell to the bigger picture. The consumer discretionary sector is breaking down against the S&P. So that’s a warning sign to me.

You have, in terms of the dynamics around what the expectation is for GDP growth, predicated upon policies that have not yet been even agreed upon, let alone voted upon, let alone implemented, let alone starting to work. So, I worry about that kind of fracture between the expectations, the patience level of stock investors, diminished returns, diminished volumes. I think there’s a stock market risk. That’s one of the reasons we like gold, because what would go hand in hand with that, was some kind of maybe statement or a pull back on the dot plot from the Fed that would then cause the dollar to come off its little rally here.

Mike Gleason: Let’s play the devil’s advocate maybe a little here. We look at these record stock prices and wonder about what is beyond this extraordinarily high valuations in the past when PE ratios hit these levels, it was a signal that markets were nearing a top. But there’s one big difference between the past and today: the advent of high frequency and machine-driven trading. Huge amounts of daily volume is generated by trading algorithms. That is a game changer. These programs don’t sense risk on an emotional level like human traders do. They respond very differently to geopolitical events. So, if today’s markets seem disconnected from reality, perhaps because it’s because they are.

Now you have been on the front lines, trading in these markets for decades. You were a witness for how markets have transformed in recent years. What is your take on high frequency and algorithmic trading and what does it say about the possibility that current equity market valuations can be sustained or maybe even pushed higher? What are your thoughts there, Greg?

Greg Weldon: That’s phenomenal question and it’s very well timed given that we did a big special in September called “Shrinkage,” which is a shift in the Fed policy here. But if you take now your question, which is pertinent now, and you look at experience, in my experience over decades, it brings back 1987 right off the bat. We’re not saying the market’s going to crash. There clearly there are a lot of differences. But when you ask about high frequency trading, it sounds to me, the first thing I think of, is portfolio insurance on steroids, times a thousand, times ten thousand. So, the risk in terms of just what is the catalyst that then causes kind of that cascading downside?

One of the things we’ve been pointing out to our customers… and by the way, I’m working out a gigantic special that shows just how intriguing some of the similarities are around movements in the dollar, movements in bonds, movements in gold, and movements in stocks, and some of the ratios, and even down to crude oil, Fed policy and CPI. Now as there was basically from 1985 to ’87, once they kicked in the Plaza Accord, which depreciated the dollar. A lot of intriguing connections there and the special report that I’m writing on this, it’s called “What, Me Worry?” which we’d love to make available to any of your listeners, first of all, if they want to email me.

But in terms of the catalyst, setting it up, again I think the landmines are laying in wait out there. I think if you take an example, one of the things, like I said we’ve been telling our customers, if you take Amazon or Google. Stock are trading at $1,000 a share. You need $1,000 to buy one share. So, the volume of trading has diminished dramatically over the last couple of years as the stock prices has gone up. The ownership is huge. And it’s passive, and it’s managed investments, it doesn’t matter, it doesn’t discriminate in terms of what type of investor. The people who want to own these stocks, own them. The dynamic between the price level being so high, nominally speaking, to buy up block shares, the amount of money needed, pure and simple, against the volume, to me, sets up something like you’re talking about that would be exacerbated by a flash crash. So, it becomes very scary in terms of what kind of meltdown could you see if you get the ball rolling to the downside.

I still think that this is something that will play out over some time. I think the Fed is there. I don’t think this is … There are a lot of differences. I’m not trying to make a direct ’87 comparison. But I’ll tell you what, the risk is there. No doubt about it. The risk is rising.

Mike Gleason: In terms of the Fed here, Greg, what is your thinking on who it might be that talks over for Janet Yellen as the next Fed chair and then also, tell us what you think they’re going to do here in terms of getting inflation to where they want? Basically, what are your general thoughts on the Fed and Fed monetary policy? Clearly everyone’s favorite subject.

Greg Weldon: Really, it’s two totally separate questions right now because who is Donald Trump going to pick versus how inflation going to play out. I think if you look at what the Fed is saying, the Fed has been very clear. This is where (Jerome) Powell becomes, what seems to be, and I’m not saying I believe this, I’m just saying it seems that Powell’s a logical choice if, IF, your goal is to maintain policy. Thinking about bringing in a guy like (John) Taylor, and the Taylor rule and where the natural level of Fed funds should be here, he would obviously be a much more hawkish choice. While him and Trump might have really gotten along, and maybe there’s a lot Trump can learn from him, I don’t think that’s the guy Trump wants in terms of policy for trying to get his growth agenda going.

In that context, how you maintain continuity, which really isn’t that bad. They’re certainly not tight and they’re not tightening to any nth degree. It’s almost Goldilocks material here, inflation aside. Powell is a logical choice because you make a headline splash, which of course he loves. You basically make a change, but you kind of keep the status quo.

The other one would be (Kevin) Warsh. He was more away from QE and towards just using interest rates. He’s an interesting kind of dark horse. Yellen is certainly a dark horse. What mattes really is how does the Fed decide they’re going to deal with this inflation issue when they can’t even decide what’s causing it? Because you keep hearing transitory, idiosyncratic. These are the words that being used repeatedly, over and over and over again to describe, and you’ve had one Fed official go so far as, and even Yellen herself has made comments to the effect of, “We don’t understand why it’s not materializing.”

Again, kind of back to the Taylor model, the basic rule of thumb that the Fed is counting on, i.e. hoping for, is that as the labor market continues to tighten wages, inflation will go up and that will support of a general rise in prices. The question now becomes is the natural rate of unemployment lower than we thought it was. Or, are there structural differences now, technologically based dynamics in the labor market that has hollowed out the labor market, the reason you still have participation rate while finally up a little, is still so low historically, therein lies the question. What is it kind of keeping inflation back and how does this play out?

I think the employment numbers from this month, for September, were huge in the sense it was the biggest wage number … and you know how I break the number down. To the nth degree, this was the real deal. Only one month, but still the real deal, and the best wage number we’ve seen since 2007. So, will that continue? We know anecdotal evidence is there. Will this continue over the next couple of months?

If you look at CPI and PPI, the pipeline, the year-over-year dynamics around some of the commodities, God forbid, grains, oil seeds, and tropical commodities started to rally because then you’d have a real problem. Look at what the base models are doing. Look at what energy potentially you’re going to break out here. So, I think there is some inflation coming and it’s apt to push the Fed to have to raise to meet their dot plots, and I think that’s going to be problematic for the equity markets. They’re walking the high wire act with no safety net. It’s a very difficult job.

Mike Gleason: Getting back to metals here for a bit. We would like to give our listeners an update on the silver and gold price rigging scandal that erupted a year and a half ago when Deutsche Bank was forced to acknowledge cheating and turned over mountains of evidence, which may prove damning for a number of other banks. But the courts and regulators have a record of moving slowly, if they do anything at all. Now you’re much closer to the futures markets than we are. Are you aware of any developments on that front and what do you see as the implications of the civil action against the bullion banks? Do you sense that the Deutsche Bank revelations here led to more honest markets, perhaps because of all that evidence struck fear into banker’s hearts or is it more business as usual for these bullion banks who seem to have so much influence in these markets, Greg?

Greg Weldon: I have the sense it’s business as usual. I get the sense that it’s a kind of laissez faire attitude about that because the problem is so big, if we were to actually kind of get unearthed, the impact would be much, much larger and we would know it based on the price section very quickly. It’s a powder keg. It’ll blow at some point. This is something, gosh I’ve been in the business how long, and we’ve been talking about this how long? Really, this goes way, way back. The degree to which it has gotten worse is, I mean, the thing you debate, not whether it exists or not. Is it going to be somehow uncovered to the extent that it causes that kind of disruption? I think again, this is probably fodder for a great movie… a spy movie or whatever.

Sure, there’s probably a lot of that kind of thing going on in background, but in terms of the day to day operation of the trading of these metals, I don’t see any tangible impact in the dealings I have here, no.

Mike Gleason: Well Greg, as we begin to close, give us a sense of what you’re focusing on here, maybe some of the things that we haven’t touched on and then give us a sense of how you’re evaluating these markets for your clients. Do you think it’s time to get defensive, go to cash, favor metals and commodities here as an inflation hedge, or does the wave of exuberance in stocks still have a ways to go? Any final comments or anything else that you want to leave us with today?

Greg Weldon: Well, I think some of that depends on whether they can actually get some kind of job done in Washington where the Republicans finally realize their own necks are on the chopping block here, so let’s finally ban together and get a tax reform package done. We’ll see whether that happens. I think that might be one of those last gas type of moves for the stock market. It could be a “buy the rumor sell the fact,” but I think lot has been priced in and I think there’s still going to be disappointment down the road for that.

I’m watching the consumer specifically. The retail sales numbers have been really poor all year. It’s minuscule gains in discretionary items since January. And the debt numbers are interesting. You’re starting to see a roll over, starting to see rise in delinquency rates. The debt obligations for consumers and for the Federal government, by the way, are high despite the fact that rates are still low. Can you imagine if the Feds actually did push rates a hundred basis points higher over the next however many, 14, 15 months? I think that would have a real reverberating effect on the consumer and on the government where deficits are still increasing and they’re at high levels again. No one talks about it. You have $20 trillion dollars in sovereign debt and you’re about to push the five-year note above 2%, which is your trigger to increase cost on funding the debt. Man, the land mines are out there.

I’m watching all of it. That’s what we do for our clients every single day because never before, have you had to be more plugged in. Look at the way things happen so much more quickly now. You asked about what’s the difference from 30 years. So much more availability of news, quickly. But the fact of the matter is, the basic thing that we do hasn’t changed at all, which is dissecting all of it, connecting all the dots, and kind of trying to make it all make sense in terms of what the markets are doing and how you might profit from that.

Mike Gleason: Well Greg, thank you so much for joining us again. We enjoyed it very much and love getting your very studied and experienced outlook on the state of today’s financial world.

bonds movements in gold and movements in stocks and some of the ratios and even down to crude oil fed policy and cpi now as there was basically from <NUMBER> to <NUMBER> once they kicked in the plaza accord which depreciated the dollar a lot of intriguing connections there and the special report that im writing on this its called what me worry which wed love to make available to any of your listeners first of all if they want to email me but in terms of the catalyst setting it up again i think the landmines are laying in wait out there i think if you take an example one of the things like i said weve been telling our customers if you take amazon or google stock are trading at <NUMBER> <NUMBER> a share you need <NUMBER> <NUMBER> to buy one share so the volume of trading has diminished dramatically over the last couple of years as the stock prices has gone up the ownership is huge and its passive and its managed investments it doesnt matter it doesnt discriminate in terms of what type of investor the people who want to own these stocks own them the dynamic between the price level being so high nominally speaking to buy up block shares the amount of money needed pure and simple against the volume to me sets up something like youre talking about that would be exacerbated by a flash crash so it becomes very scary in terms of what kind of meltdown could you see if you get the ball rolling to the downside i still think that this is something that will play out over some time i think the fed is there i dont think this is there are a lot of differences im not trying to make a direct <NUMBER> comparison but ill tell you what the risk is there no doubt about it the risk is rising mike gleason in terms of the fed here greg what is your thinking on who it might be that talks over for janet yellen as the next fed chair and then also tell us what you think theyre going to do here in terms of getting inflation to where they want basically what are your general thoughts on the fed and fed monetary policy clearly everyones favorite subject greg weldon really its two totally separate questions right now because who is donald trump going to pick versus how inflation going to play out i think if you look at what the fed is saying the fed has been very clear this is where jerome powell becomes what seems to be and im not saying i believe this im just saying it seems that powells a logical choice if if your goal is to maintain policy thinking about bringing in a guy like john taylor and the taylor rule and where the natural level of fed funds should be here he would obviously be a much more hawkish choice while him and trump might have really gotten along and maybe theres a lot trump can learn from him i dont think thats the guy trump wants in terms of policy for trying to get his growth agenda going in that context how you maintain continuity which really isnt that bad theyre certainly not tight and theyre not tightening to any nth degree its almost goldilocks material here inflation aside powell is a logical choice because you make a headline splash which of course he loves you basically make a change but you kind of keep the status quo the other one would be kevin warsh he was more away from qe and towards just using interest rates hes an interesting kind of dark horse yellen is certainly a dark horse what mattes really is how does the fed decide theyre going to deal with this inflation issue when they cant even decide whats causing it because you keep hearing transitory idiosyncratic these are the words that being used repeatedly over and over and over again to describe and youve had one fed official go so far as and even yellen herself has made comments to the effect of we dont understand why its not materializing again kind of back to the taylor model the basic rule of thumb that the fed is counting on ie hoping for is that as the labor market continues to tighten wages inflation will go up and that will support of a general rise in prices the question now becomes is the natural rate of unemployment lower than we thought it was or are there structural differences now technologically based dynamics in the labor market that has hollowed out the labor market the reason you still have participation rate while finally up a little is still so low historically therein lies the question what is it kind of keeping inflation back and how does this play out i think the employment numbers from this month for september were huge in the sense it was the biggest wage number and you know how i break the number down to the nth degree this was the real deal only one month but still the real deal and the best wage number weve seen since <NUMBER> so will that continue we know anecdotal evidence is there will this continue over the next couple of months if you look at cpi and ppi the pipeline the yearoveryear dynamics around some of the commodities god forbid grains oil seeds and tropical commodities started to rally because then youd have a real problem look at what the base models are doing look at what energy potentially youre going to break out here so i think there is some inflation coming and its apt to push the fed to have to raise to meet their dot plots and i think thats going to be problematic for the equity markets theyre walking the high wire act with no safety net its a very difficult job mike gleason getting back to metals here for a bit we would like to give our listeners an update on the silver and gold price rigging scandal that erupted a year and a half ago when deutsche bank was forced to acknowledge cheating and turned over mountains of evidence which may prove damning for a number of other banks but the courts and regulators have a record of moving slowly if they do anything at all now youre much closer to the futures markets than we are are you aware of any developments on that front and what do you see as the implications of the civil action against the bullion banks do you sense that the deutsche bank revelations here led to more honest markets perhaps because of all that evidence struck fear into bankers hearts or is it more business as usual for these bullion banks who seem to have so much influence in these markets greg greg weldon i have the sense its business as usual i get the sense that its a kind of laissez faire attitude about that because the problem is so big if we were to actually kind of get unearthed the impact would be much much larger and we would know it based on the price section very quickly its a powder keg itll blow at some point this is something gosh ive been in the business how long and weve been talking about this how long really this goes way way back the degree to which it has gotten worse is i mean the thing you debate not whether it exists or not is it going to be somehow uncovered to the extent that it causes that kind of disruption i think again this is probably fodder for a great movie a spy movie or whatever sure theres probably a lot of that kind of thing going on in background but in terms of the day to day operation of the trading of these metals i dont see any tangible impact in the dealings i have here no mike gleason well greg as we begin to close give us a sense of what youre focusing on here maybe some of the things that we havent touched on and then give us a sense of how youre evaluating these markets for your clients do you think its time to get defensive go to cash favor metals and commodities here as an inflation hedge or does the wave of exuberance in stocks still have a ways to go any final comments or anything else that you want to leave us with today greg weldon well i think some of that depends on whether they can actually get some kind of job done in washington where the republicans finally realize their own necks are on the chopping block here so lets finally ban together and get a tax reform package done well see whether that happens i think that might be one of those last gas type of moves for the stock market it could be a buy the rumor sell the fact but i think lot has been priced in and i think theres still going to be disappointment down the road for that im watching the consumer specifically the retail sales numbers have been really poor all year its minuscule gains in discretionary items since january and the debt numbers are interesting youre starting to see a roll over starting to see rise in delinquency rates the debt obligations for consumers and for the federal government by the way are high despite the fact that rates are still low can you imagine if the feds actually did push rates a hundred basis points higher over the next however many <NUMBER> <NUMBER> months i think that would have a real reverberating effect on the consumer and on the government where deficits are still increasing and theyre at high levels again no one talks about it you have <NUMBER> trillion dollars in sovereign debt and youre about to push the fiveyear note above <NUMBER> which is your trigger to increase cost on funding the debt man the land mines are out there im watching all of it thats what we do for our clients every single day because never before have you had to be more plugged in look at the way things happen so much more quickly now you asked about whats the difference from <NUMBER> years so much more availability of news quickly but the fact of the matter is the basic thing that we do hasnt changed at all which is dissecting all of it connecting all the dots and kind of trying to make it all make sense in terms of what the markets are doing and how you might profit from that mike gleason well greg thank you so much for joining us again we enjoyed it very much and love

95,15764,washingtonexaminer.com,political,http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/the-nine-biggest-benghazi-committee-discoveries/article/2595294,"Democrats both on and off the House Select Committee on Benghazi skewered an 800-page report made public Tuesday by panel Republicans for presenting no new facts about the Sept. 11, 2012 terror attack.

Aside from questioning 81 witnesses that had never before been interviewed by congressional investigators, the select committee reviewed thousands of previously undisclosed documents and drew new conclusions about the administration's handling of the terror attack.

Below are nine things the Benghazi committee uncovered in its 25-month investigation.

Email server

Hillary Clinton's use of a private email account and server was unknown to previous congressional committees that looked into the circumstances surrounding Benghazi.

Dozens of emails discussing the attack and Libya were hidden on that server, including some that shed light on how Clinton and her aides initially sought to take ""ownership"" of the Libyan invasion.

When news of Clinton's private email use first broke in March 2015, the Benghazi committee seemingly entered a new, highly-politicized phase. Her server scandal took off just as she was preparing to enter the presidential race, injecting partisan vitriol into an investigation that had proceeded in relative quiet up to that point.

The examination of Clinton's private emails led the committee to a previously unknown force that had helped shape the secretary of state's policy in the run-up to Benghazi: Sidney Blumenthal.

Blumenthal behind the scenes

A divisive political operative who was barred from working in the Obama administration, Sidney Blumenthal provided unvetted intelligence to Clinton about Libya even as he attempted to cultivate business opportunities in the war-torn country.

Blumenthal appeared before the committee in June 2015, where his commercial dealings and potential conflicts of interest were questioned in a closed-door interview.

At issue was the fact that a partisan figure had a direct line to the secretary of state on matters as sensitive as the regime change in Libya. In fact, many of Blumenthal's missives to Clinton have since been marked classified by the State Department.

The extent of Blumenthal's influence was not uncovered in previous investigations of Benghazi.

Hillary's upcoming visit

The select committee revealed Clinton herself was set to visit Libya weeks after the Sept. 11, 2012 attack, a plan that was scrapped after the Benghazi raid.

That scheduled trip was one of many instances that highlighted the State Department's severe misreading of the security situation in Libya.

Clinton's planned visit had implications for Ambassador Chris Stevens, who was laying the groundwork for her travel when he was killed in the attack

Gregory Hicks, deputy chief of mission in Libya, told committee investigators the ambassador's stay in Benghazi was ""absolutely"" related to Clinton's visit.

Permanent post

Stevens had journeyed to Benghazi to work on a ""deliverable"" for Clinton's upcoming trip, the select committee revealed.

His work on that deliverable involved preparing a proposal to turn the temporary diplomatic compound in Benghazi into a permanent post.

""[W]e had begun the process of developing a political rationale for having a permanent post in Benghazi,"" Hicks testified.

The report said State Department discussions of Benghazi's deteriorating security situation earlier in 2012 framed outbreaks of violence as ""anomalies"" as officials forged ahead with a plan to establish a diplomatic presence in the coastal Libyan city.

Given his now-famous affection for the people of Libya, Stevens was an advocate of the plan.

Gadhafi rescuers

The select committee discovered a group that ""most U.S. Government personnel did not even know existed"" helped the Americans trapped at the CIA annex escape on the morning of Sept. 12.

""This group, ironically, had close ties to the former Gadhafi regime — the very regime the United States had helped remove from power,"" the report said.

The report credited that group, which was affiliated with deposed dictator Muammar Gadhafi, with sparing ""dozens of lives.""

According to the select committee's findings, a CIA agent who had never previously been interviewed by other congressional investigators facilitated the evacuation with the Gadhafi militia's help. The CIA was ""reluctant"" to allow the committee to interview that agent.

The ""Libyan Military Intelligence,"" as the group was known, arrived with a motorcade of 50 vehicles to transport the State Department and CIA personnel under siege at the annex to the airport, where they could be evacuated to Tripoli.

Some of those vehicles were fitted with machine guns and others had secure fixtures that would allow the fleet to escape with the Americans while taking fire.

The CIA agent in question had contacted the Libyan Military Intelligence for help after receiving a referral from a ""helpless"" contingent of local police officers who had been tapped to secure the annex but proved unable to do so.

The committee focused on the fact that, for all of the State Department's focus on cultivating relationships with the burgeoning Libyan government, the only people who tried to help the Americans were those cast aside by the agency.

""[S]ome of the very individuals the United States had helped remove from power during the Libyan revolution were the only Libyans that came to the assistance of the United States on the night of the Benghazi attacks,"" the report said.

Uniform problems

Marines in Rota, Spain who were awaiting orders to head for Benghazi experienced hours of delay due to concern about what they were wearing, one witness told the select committee.

After C-130 planes reached the base and the Marines, who were part of a Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team known as a FAST force, prepared to take off for Tripoli, a three-hour delay ensued due to deliberations about whether the company members should wear their military uniforms or civilian clothes, and whether they would be permitted to carry weapons.

""[W]e were told multiple times to change what we were wearing,"" the platoon commander testified. ""There was also some talk of whether or not we could carry our personal weapons.""

The commander testified that he advocated for his team to be allowed to carry weapons because they were headed into ""a very violent thing going on the ground.""

In all, the Marines were forced to change their clothes four times before they were deployed to Libya, according to testimony.

Gen. Carter Ham, the-commander of AFRICOM, told the committee he did not learn of the uniform changes ""until after the fact"" and even then could not pinpoint a reason for the three-hour delay in Rota.

That delay had come after the C-130s took six hours to arrive from Germany despite receiving orders to fly there at once.

""The fact that nearly twenty-four hours elapsed until those [FAST] forces actually arrived in Tripoli to reinforce the security there belies the expectations of the American people that the U.S. Military can and will move expeditiously,"" the committee report said.

Discussions over whether to force the FAST Marines to wear civilian clothes took place in Washington, where high-level officials expressed concerns about a military show of force in Libya.

""[T]hey wanted to minimize the signature that looked like a big military invasion, a big military arrival there,"" one witness testified.

Rather than increase the safety of the Marines en route to Benghazi, ""the benefit of having the FAST platoon wear civilian clothing was to cater to unexpressed Libyan Government concerns about military appearances,"" the report said.

According to the report, Patrick Kennedy, the State Department's undersecretary for management, suggested the FAST platoon shed their uniforms during a key White House meeting the night of the attack.

White House meeting

Around 7:30 p.m. Washington time on the night of the raid, high-level officials gathered via secure video teleconference to discuss the events unfolding in Benghazi. Neither President Obama nor Defense Secretary Leon Panetta was present.

Clinton attended, as well as several of her top aides and Kennedy.

The meeting was not convened until four hours after the attack began. Sean Smith and Stevens had already died.

""Despite the Secretary [of Defense]'s expectation the assets he ordered to deploy would move as fast as possible in order to respond, the individuals who participated in the White House meeting, nevertheless, felt the need to 'work through' the assets the Secretary had already ordered to deploy,"" the report said.

Republicans on the committee noted that meeting participants became ""surprisingly unable to recall details"" about what was discussed that night when they were questioned by investigators.

Although an email sent by the Pentagon's chief of staff just before the conference indicated forces were ""spinning up"" and preparing to deploy, the report indicated ""it was clear by the end of the White House meeting that no forces were going to Benghazi.""

Diplomatic niceties

Administration officials placed tremendous importance on the way their actions would be perceived in Libya during the attack, the report found.

For example, military assets in Europe were not allowed to take off for Benghazi until the administration received clearance from the Libyan government to enter Libyan airspace.

But the process was lengthy and required a Libyan government official to receive paperwork for the request in person when no such official was on duty overnight as the attacks were unfolding.

Before the raid even began, diplomatic concerns prevented the State Department from greenlighting a higher security profile for the ambassador in Benghazi even though the conditions in the country warranted one.

'No connection' to Cairo

For weeks after the Benghazi attack, the administration attempted to link the violence in Libya to a relatively peaceful protest in Cairo hours earlier that had erupted over an inflammatory YouTube clip.

Internal correspondence obtained by the committee suggests that, rather than receiving conflicting intelligence on the matter, the administration knew within hours that the attack in Benghazi had little to do with the demonstrations in Cairo.

""For [press] guidance, if pressed whether we see a connection between these two. We have no information regarding a connection between these incidents."" Nuland wrote of the events in Benghazi and Cairo within two hours of the administration learning of the Benghazi attack.

Kennedy told congressional staff in a subsequent briefing that the Benghazi attack had no relation to the Cairo protest because the demonstrators in Cairo had no weapons and simply spray-painted some illustrations near the Cairo embassy.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,The nine biggest Benghazi committee discoveries,Sarah Westwood,,"['Sarah

We are inching towards World War III and I believe we are but moments away. In a recent turn of events Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has escalated his conflict with Turkish President Erdogan over the downing of the Russian bomber, by declaring Syria a no-fly zone for Turkish aircraft.

According to Putin, “Turkey used to violate Syrian airspace all the time. Let them try and fly there now.”

Gary Franchi’s Next News Network brings us more on this breaking report:

Furthermore, amid the Turkey and Russia tensions, Putin has been stepping up his rhetoric in what just might be a step towards war with the West. Putin also told a session of the Defense Ministry’s Collegium in which he stated that, “Any targets that threaten Russian forces or our infrastructure on the group should be immediately destroyed.”

Here is that breaking report brought to you by Gary Franchi’s the Next News Network…

151,23970,beforeitsnews.com,fake,http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2016/06/a-rothschild-passed-on-the-day-of-the-orlando-shooting-3370375.html,"When he read the 1992 Maastricht Treaty Leach became convinced the EU was ‘a bureaucratic oligarchy, not a democracy’

It was when he first read the full text of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty that Leach became convinced the EU was “a bureaucratic oligarchy, not a democracy”. He opposed the idea of a “European constitution” that would be designed to centralise power in Brussels. And as support grew in the mid-1990s for British membership of the single currency, he became convinced that a “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy could not work for widely differing national economies.

In 1998 – at a time when the prime minister Tony Blair was positioning the UK to join the euro with the full-hearted support of the CBI and many members of the business establishment – Leach founded Business for Sterling to co-ordinate the case against.

The lobby group gradually recruited a thousand chairmen and chief executives to its cause and gathered momentum around the country until the pro-euro side largely faded away. But when asked whether he had personally saved Britain from a dangerous fate, Leach was self-effacing: “If there was credit it should be spread very, very broadly. I was just the chairman.”

On the issue of enlargement, Leach remarked that ‘the democratic deficit … gets worse every time there is more Europe’

In 2005 he set up Open Europe, a think-tank dedicated to scrutinising and challenging every aspect of the European project, from the minutiae of financial regulation to the constitutional issues of enlargement, on which Leach remarked that “the democratic deficit … gets worse every time there is more Europe”.

But his approach was constructive. Having won the battle against euro membership, he said, “we now want to fight a much longer war to make something good happen.” His vision was of “a much more efficient Europe… that Britain would be at ease with”: a “neighbourly alliance” in which those nations that wanted to share economic sovereignty and those that just wanted co-operation and trade would be equally welcome.

As for the 2016 referendum on UK membership of the EU, Leach condemned what he called “adversarial claptrap” from the opposing politicians, and was guarded in expressing his own preference. In contrast to many voices warning that “Brexit” could bring economic disaster, Open Europe’s research indicated that the impact of British departure could be positive or negative, depending on subsequent trade deals and deregulation measures – but either way was likely to be relatively modest in scale.

In an interview for The Spectator conducted in February (before David Cameron’s “renegotiation” of membership terms) Leach spoke of the value of continuing UK pressure for EU reform, and seemed to lean towards Remain. He had still made no public declaration when in mid-April, while chairing an Open Europe debate, he suffered a severe stroke.

However, an email he had sent to a friend in March was subsequently published: “We aren’t ever going to sacrifice our democracy, and the EU cannot ever develop a democracy, as it hasn’t got a demos… So it has to be exit, painful though that may temporarily be.”

Charles Guy Rodney Leach was born in Dublin on June 1 1934. He was educated at Harrow and Balliol College, Oxford – where he took a First in Greats and won all four of the Latin and Greek verse and prose composition prizes (his older brother Colin having won three). He embarked on an academic career, having “never given the slightest thought” to what he might do otherwise. It was the Hungarian uprising of 1956 that jolted him into a wider awareness: he helped to found the Oxford-Hungarian relief fund for refugee camps, recalling later: “This was the real world and it was a revelation… Here were people longing to be free, and it was deeply exciting.”

Thereafter he decided on a financial career and – as many bright young men did in that era – embarked for Canada, where he worked for the brokerage and investment firm of Greenshields in Montreal, under the tutelage of George Cretzianu, a former Romanian finance minister who had escaped from the Russians.

Returning to London, Leach was recruited into NM Rothschild & Sons in 1963 by his Oxford friend Jacob (now Lord) Rothschild, who was a junior partner in the family banking house. As a partner from 1968, and joint head of corporate finance, Leach acquired a reputation as a master of financial complexities: the triumvirate of Leach, Jacob Rothschild and the former barrister Philip (later Sir Philip) Shelbourne took the bank to the forefront of City dealmaking, both in the fast-growing Eurobond market and in mergers and acquisitions.

In the latter sphere, as adviser to the American company Leasco in its bid for Pergamon Press in 1969, Leach was obliged to face down Pergamon’s owner, Robert Maxwell. The Rothschild team rightly suspected false accounting behind Pergamon’s reported profits – and Leach was invited to discuss the matter at Maxwell’s home, Headington Hall, near Oxford. Having received sinister warnings about what Maxwell might be capable of, Leach agreed to attend only on the basis that telephone calls would be made to the mansion at specified times – and if Leach did not answer them, the police would be called. Maxwell was unperturbed by the condition, appearing to think it quite normal – but he treated Leach more respectfully thereafter.

In 1972 Leach first came to the attention of the then taipan of Jardines in Hong Kong, Henry Keswick, when Rothschild was called in to defend Dairy Farm, a local retail chain with valuable property assets, against a hostile takeover bid by Jardines’ subsidiary Hong Kong Land. In a bitter battle the bidder eventually prevailed, but Leach extracted a rich price.

Four years later – having become caught up in tensions between Jacob and his cousin (Sir) Evelyn de Rothschild, by then chairman of the bank – Leach left Rothschilds to work for the Lebanese financier Edmond Safra (who had been a Rothschilds client) in his Swiss-based Trade Development Bank. But when Safra sold most of the business in 1983 to American Express, Leach left for Matheson & Co, the London holding company of Jardine Matheson. Its Lombard Street office became his base of operations for the rest of his life; he was an executive director until he was past 80, squeezing his campaigning activities “between the hours of 6am and 8am and after 6pm, at weekends and on holiday”.

As Jardines’ financial strategist, and a director of its group companies, Leach devised the structure of cross-shareholdings which maintain Keswick family control and protect the group against takeover bids. He was also behind the controversial transfer of domicile of group companies from Hong Kong to Bermuda in the mid-1980s and their stock market listing in London as well as Hong Kong, in anticipation of the transfer of sovereignty to communist China.

In 2006 he returned to the Rothschild fold in a non-executive capacity as a director of Paris Orléans (now Rothschild & Co), the holding company of the French and British branches of the empire. He was a member of the British Library’s board.

Rodney Leach published Europe: a Concise Encyclopedia of the European Union in 1998. He was created a life peer, as Lord Leach of Fairford, in 2006, having been nominated by the Conservative leader Michael Howard in recognition of his European campaigns: one commentator imagined Tony Blair eyeing the list of nominations and muttering: “Not that man Leach, dammit.”

Leach was also a force behind the “No to AV” campaign which in 2011 helped defeat the Liberal Democrats’ proposal to replace first-past-the-post parliamentary elections with the “alternative vote” system of proportional representation.

Leach was an avid competitive bridge player at the Portland Club. He married first, in 1963, Felicity Ballantyne, whom he had met in Canada. The marriage was dissolved in 1989 and he married secondly, in 1993, Jessica Douglas-Home, widow of the Times editor Charles Douglas-Home.

Jessica had worked with Romanian dissidents before the fall of the Soviet empire and was, Rodney observed, “more of a revolutionary than me”: it was she who first urged him to immerse himself in the small print of the Maastricht treaty. She survives him with two sons and three daughters of the first marriage.

CIA Refuses To Show Evidence Linking Trump To Russia Because It Would Help Russia!

In the weeks subsequently after Donald Trump was elected president, CIA analysts who work on Russia refreshed their analysis about Russian cyber meddling. They earlier had considered that Russia was attempting to undermine the U.S. presidential election, but after Nov. 8 they came to assume that Russian interference was truly created to help Trump win.

This latest finding fertilized an currently blazing public argument between the U.S. intelligence agencies and the president-elect over Russian interference in the election.

“I don’t believe it,” Trump stated in an interview shown Sunday on Fox News, discussing the idea that the Russians desired to assist him. “I think it’s ridiculous.”

Trump and his aides deny not just the CIA’s updated review about Russian objectives, but the early consensus reached by all 17 agencies, and revealed in a rare joint public statement by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and DHS head Jeh Johnson, that Russia was meddling in the election in the first place.

The significance of the gulf can barely be overstated: numerous foreign policy experts and lawmakers think Russia’s behavior was an assault on the nation. One ex – CIA leader, Hillary Clinton advocate Michael Morell, compared Russia’s invasion into U.S. politics Friday to “the political equivalent of 9/11.”

The truth is, the CIA’s latest take is not the unanimous perspective of the intelligence community. Clapper, who oversees all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, had sufficient confidence to exchange the CIA’s review to Congress in a secret briefing last week. But no similar review has leaked from any of the other 16 intelligence agencies.

The FBI, for its portion, determines that Russia’s main goal was to stow mayhem and challenge American democracy, a senior law enforcement official explained to NBC News. Aiding Trump provided that objective, the official stated, but Russia didn’t anticipate Trump to win the election.

The CIA’s review that the Russians preferred Trump was not determined by any single piece of new intelligence, officials briefed on the matter explained to NBC News. Rather, it was the outcome of more stringent analysis of a growing body of circumstantial proof more comprehensive than anything the public has observed.

Human sources, communications intercepts and other intelligence have permitted analysts to piece together the details of some of the players, and the steps they took to harm Clinton’s candidacy while boosting Trump’s, officials stated.

The CIA also believed that while Russian hackers collected information on Republicans, they did not release any of it, the way they did with Democratic emails leaked to WikiLeaks. The Republican National Committee rejects its systems were hacked, but the emails of individual Republicans were collected-something NBC News documented in October.

The FBI is convinced the Russians did not find anything volatile in the Republican material they acquired, the official stated, despite the fact that it’s not apparent whether any U.S. agency understands the full extent of what data Russian hackers were capable to steal.

The CIA also tracked a campaign of anti-Clinton news reports amplified by social media, some of which came from Russian state media outlets, officials shared with NBC News.

The case that the Russian campaign was clearly supposed to elect Trump is not something the U.S. could demonstrate in court, officials point out, which in part clarifies why FBI briefers have been more hesitant to embrace that situation in secret briefings to Congress than have intelligence officials. Other intelligence agencies have not supported the CIA perspective, but no entity is acknowledged to oppose it.

Nevertheless, the question of motive-why the Russians purportedly meddled in the election – is completely independent from the more basic question of whether the U.S. has strong proof that the Russian government sponsored the concealed campaign.

On that score, every intelligence agency in the government confirms: The Russians did it.

In October, DNI Clapper and Homeland security Secretary Jeh Johnson released an extraordinary joint statement that “the U.S. Intelligence Community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.”

One source acquainted with the intelligence stated it incorporated profiles of some of the suspects with photographs, and could lead to inevitable indictments of specific Russian actors, if the Justice Department chooses to go after them.

The proof on that score basically doesn’t help Trump’s recent commentary that “It could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey.”

That is why the two Trump proponents who lead the Congressional intelligence committees, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Rep. Devin Nunes of California, have each supplied statements in recent days conveying worry about Russian hacking.

“The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has been, and remains, concerned about Russia’s actions,” Burr stated in report to NBC News Friday.

Nunes stated Friday: “Russia’s cyber attacks are no surprise to the House Intelligence Committee, which has been closely monitoring Russia’s belligerence for years.”

On Monday, the top Republicans in Congress – Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan – each released statements pledging to investigate Russian meddling in the election.

Ryan called Russia “an aggressor,” and McConnell made a point of saying he has “the highest confidence in the intelligence community, and especially the Central Intelligence Agency.”

On Monday, Sen. John McCain of Arizona renewed his call for a bipartisan hearing, but stated he didn’t think Russians were attempting to engineer a Trump victory: “That’s the reason we need a full investigation, but I have seen no evidence of that.”

It’s actual uncertain whether Trump has been briefed on the same facts top Republicans have observed, because he has had only a handful of intelligence briefings since the election.

Trump not only stated he didn’t believe the intelligence community’s review – he recommended that the CIA was not to be believed in general, providing a statement Friday night observing that “These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.”

Several intelligence officials explained to NBC News they were seriously annoyed by that statement. There is no historical precedent for a president-elect publicly maligning the intelligence agencies he is about to lead.

One big dilemma currently is how Trump’s pick as CIA director, Mike Pompeo, will bridge the acrimonious gap between his boss and the agency he leads.

President Barack Obama doesn’t plan to make it effortless on Trump: He has requested that a dossier be assembled on the data about the Russian covert operation.

A senior Obama administration official shared with NBC News that parts of that will be made public prior to January 20th.

Sen. Angus King, a Maine Independent who serves on the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated to NBC News that can not occur soon enough. The way to circumvent Russian information campaigns is to publicize them, he stated.

He cautioned, however, is that the U.S. Is not going to be able offer the sort of evidence many skeptics are requiring.

“If you provide proof, you provide a roadmap to show the Russians how we caught them,” he stated, “including intelligence sources and methods.”

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

Something that modern civilization has counted upon during times of crisis is outside help from those in a better situation. News of disaster travels around the region, sometimes whole areas of the world, and people donate time and money to assist those who are in a bad way.

The process of Decline is hastened by climate change because of the limits that are reached as resources are strained to the breaking as disasters pile up.

Here is an NPR article about this very process unfolding this very year:

www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/09/29/554291950/what-the-pileup-of-u-s-disasters-means-for-the-world

Listing donations during every subsequent disaster this year showing a marked decline, the article goes on to say:

“All this has happened as the world was already grappling with some of the largest humanitarian crises since World War II: 20 million people at risk of dying from starvation and disease due to conflicts and drought in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen.

So within the U.S. government it’s not just exclusively domestic agencies like FEMA that are in all-hands-on-deck mode right now. At the CDC, where Talley works for a branch that focuses on overseas emergencies, “we have staff around the world responding.”

Similarly, USAID, the agency that delivers U.S. assistance to poor countries, has deployed six separate disaster response teams — which can consist of as many as several dozen staffers — including teams to help displaced people from Syria and Iraq.

“This is only the second time that we’ve had six teams mobilized at once,” notes Alex Mahoney, a top official with the agency’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, or OFDA.

The last time was during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. “So yes, it’s unusual,” he says.“

It’s well worth reading, and explains that agencies all over the world that rely on U.S. support– including the U.S.!– are stretched to their limits and beyond. Donations are dropping in a process that is called “donation fatigue” due to both private parties and governmental organizations using their volunteers and resources until no more of either is left, and replacements are slow to arrive.

It appears that any more disasters after this pile up may well face the unthinkable: little to no help at all.

The timing appears to be part of the problem with the lack of help for Puerto Rico, for instance. Or the devastating fires in California…. we are at the point where both funds and active participants are just about OUT of commission.

I believe that climate change means more years will be like this last one and that soon– maybe within a decade– it may well be that local disasters will be met with local help and not much more than that, and many devastating disaster survivors will find they are on their own. This would mean that the collapse of modern civilization may take far less time than typical Declines of previous eras. The mentality of generosity to strangers could shift to that of battening down the hatches for your own area and people.

We all should hope not. The longer we can maintain infrastructures and constant contact around the world, the easier the descent will be, ultimately.

The US Dollar extended this week’s rally from 3-month lows on the currency market, pushing the Euro down to $1.19205, a 7-session low.

That held the price of wholesale gold investment bars above €1100 per ounce for French, German and Italian investors, its strongest level for nearly 9 weeks.

China’s Yuan also fell against the Dollar, while Shanghai gold premiums – an indicator of demand and supply inside the world’s No.1 mining, importing and consumer nation – slipped back to $7 per ounce above London quotes.

With only 5 weeks until China’s peak Lunar New Year shopping season, that was near the weakest incentive for new bullion imports since mid-September.

“Gold could finally break out of its four-year trading range if inflation starts to lift globally,” says a new 2018 commodities outlook from former London bullion clearing bank Barclays, tipping mining stocks more broadly as “compelling [on] a strengthening macro backdrop , limited capex, strong earnings momentum…cheap valuation multiples and light [investor] positioning.”

Shorter term, “Gold should see [support] at the recent low of $1315 and the psychological $1300 level below that,” reckons Swiss refining and finance group MKS Pamp’s Asian trading desk.

“On the upside, a break above lasts weeks high of $1324 could see the yellow metal make a move on the September top of $1355.”

The September peak “will be a decisive level for a larger up trend” agrees French investment and bullion market-making bank Societe Generale’s technical analysis team today, calling that $1350-1356 level “the neckline” of a “large Inverted Head and Shoulder pattern.”

This major reversal pattern “forms after a downtrend,” explains StockCharts. “[It] contains three successive troughs with the middle trough (head) being the deepest and the two outside troughs (shoulders) being shallower.

“A clear move above $1356 will mean confirmation of the formation,” says SocGen’s note, “and this will lead to next leg of up move towards $1433/1485 first.”

“It is quite possible that the yellow metal could attempt to hit $1357 in the not too distant future,” says a separate note from Canadian brokerage TD Securities, “[because] investors seem ready to take hefty long gold positions even as equity markets are surging.”

Last week’s positioning data for Comex gold futures and options showed the sharpest jump in speculative bullish betting by money managers, net of that group’s bearish bets, since mid-August.

TD’s Bart Melek gave the best 2017 average gold price forecast in industry body the LBMA’s annual competition last year, predicting $1257 per ounce against the $1256 out-turn at London’s afternoon benchmarking.

He now forecasts a 4.5% rise in gold for 2018, predicting an average annual price of $1313 per ounce.

Near term, “A move toward $1375 is possible should the market believe the US central bank will be gentle in their rate hike signaling,” says TD’s latest note.",2018-01-25 20:13:50.426130,2018-02-02
