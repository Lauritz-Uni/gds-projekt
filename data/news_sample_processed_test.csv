Magnesium is already known by many as a tremendous booster of health. It contributes to sound sleep, helps with digestion and constipation, relieves muscle aches, and even improves heart health and migraine headaches – but here’s a shocker: magnesium in small doses leads to an astonishing reversal of depression.

What is Magnesium and Why Do We Need it?

Magnesium is one of the most important elements in the human body. It is a micronutrient and mineral that is involved in thousands of biochemical processes crucial for the proper functioning of the cardiovascular, alimentary, endocrine, and osteoarticular systems, but oddly, it seems absolutely vital to regulating our mood and levels of happiness.

In a breakthrough study conducted by researchers at the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont and published in PLoS ONE has found that just 248mg of magnesium per day leads to an about-face of depression symptoms in study subjects.

“New clinical research results show magnesium is effective at addressing symptoms and is safer and easier on the wallet than prescription therapies,” reports Science Daily.

Mounds of Research Proving We Need Magnesium to Combat Depression

Research of this kind regarding magnesium isn’t new, but it stands to reinforce what nutritionists, health coaches, and even some psychologists have been stating for decades.

Another study states this about magnesium and depression:

“Anxiety related conditions are the most common affective disorders present in the general population with a lifetime prevalence of over 15%. Magnesium (Mg) status is associated with subjective anxiety, leading to the proposition that Mg supplementation may attenuate anxiety symptoms.”

And this study explains that:

“After adjusting for all potential confounders, the strength of the association of very low magnesium intake with depression was statistically significant (RR = 1.16; 95% CI, 1.06-1.30).”

Or how about this study which states that the daily consumption of 500 mg magnesium:

“. . . tablets for ≥8 wk by depressed patients suffering from magnesium deficiency leads to improvements in depression status and magnesium levels.”

So, while not all the studies agree on the exact amount of magnesium that we need each day to combat depression, they repeat over and over in hundreds of additional studies, that depleted magnesium levels contribute to depression.

Why We’re All Magnesium Deficient

Depleted Soil

Why are so many of us magnesium deficient, aside from the fact that many vital micronutrients and minerals we need have been raped from the soil via industrial farming practices, and by adding non-organic, toxic chemical fertilizers and herbicides to the very soil which must grow our food?

Too Much Sugar

We also eat too much sugar. Is this a coincidence? The sugar industry has been hiding the effects of sugar on us for decades – and one of those effects is that sugar eats up our magnesium stores.

Refined sugar causes you to waste most vitamin and minerals in the body, mainly B-Vitamins, Potassium, Magnesium, Zinc and Manganese. Sugar raises CO2 levels in the blood, which causes you to go to bicarbonate stores which buffer it, causing a depletion of minerals like magnesium.

Stress

Another culprit is stress – both mental and physical stress, with its related continuous flow of adrenaline, uses up our magnesium stores rapidly. Adrenaline affects heart rate, blood pressure, vascular constriction and muscle contraction— actions that all demand steady supplies of magnesium for smooth function, and without it you can guess what happens.

We also require magnesium to create serotonin, one of the “happy hormones” which prevents depression. Stress causes less serotonin to be created, and replaces it with cortisol and other stress hormones. Stress and depression are inextricably linked. Without enough magnesium we haven’t got a chance at fighting depression naturally.

Detoxification

Magnesium is a powerful detoxifier. It removes everything from heavy metals, to glyphosate and other herbicides from our bodies, as well as thousands of environmental toxins and metabolic toxins. If we become overly toxic, due to a lack of magnesium, we are more likely be depressed as the brain suffers from inflammation it cannot overcome.

Is it any wonder we suffer from the following additional diseases, aside from depression, all of which are linked to magnesium deficiency?

Gastrointestinal disorders: Prolonged diarrhea, Crohn’s disease, malabsorption syndromes, celiac disease, surgical removal of a portion of the intestine, and intestinal inflammation due to radiation may all lead to magnesium depletion.



Renal disorders (magnesium wasting): Diabetes mellitus and long-term use of certain diuretics (see Drug interactions) may result in increased urinary loss of magnesium. Multiple other medications can also result in renal magnesium wasting.



Chronic alcoholism: Poor dietary intake, gastrointestinal problems, and increased urinary loss of magnesium may all contribute to magnesium depletion, which is frequently encountered in alcoholics.



Age: Several studies have found that elderly people have relatively low dietary intakes of magnesium. Intestinal magnesium absorption tends to decrease with age and urinary magnesium excretion tends to increase with age; thus, suboptimal dietary magnesium intake may increase the risk of magnesium depletion in the elderly.

How Much Magnesium Do I Need And Where Can I Get It?

So how much magnesium should you take? General dosage recommendations range from about 3 to 10 milligrams per pound of body weight. Experiment with a supplement and you’ll know exactly how much you need.

You can also consume natural sources of magnesium which can be found in foods like:

Spinach

Chard

Almonds

Greek Yogurt

Black Beans

Avocado

Coriander

Salmon

Pumpkin seeds

Yogurt or Kefir

Figs

Dark Chocolate

Banana

Cashews

Goat Cheese

Artichokes

73,12075,washingtonexaminer.com,political,http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/sen-john-kennedy-compares-school-choice-to-mayonnaise/article/2625082,"School choice is often compared to many things, but Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., came up with a new one on Tuesday: mayonnaise.

""I can go down to my over-priced Capitol Hill grocery this afternoon and choose among about six different types of mayonnaise,"" Kennedy said. ""How come I can't do that for my kid in school?""

Well, that's a new one.

Comparisons between grocery stores and school choice are a fairly common comparison. If, for example, food stamp recipients were only allowed to use their benefits at the nearest grocery store, there would be outrage. Low-income families would be stuck shopping at low-quality convenience stores while the wealthy would be free to shop at the grocery stores of their choice.

Kennedy's comparison wasn't too far out there, but it was funny nonetheless.

Not everyone was amused by Kennedy's quip. ""Education is not mayonnaise, and the day we choose to treat public education like the marketing of our condiments we have given up on our kids,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said later in the hearing.

Kennedy, apparently not one to mince words or spread them on slices of whole-grain bread, produced another giggle-worthy moment at the Senate subcommittee hearing when he asked Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, ""You're aware, I'm sure, that some people don't like you because you support vouchers and charter schools?""

DeVos took this answer in stride, replying with a grin, said, ""I'm peripherally aware of that, yes.""

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

I am a mother of four in my mid 30\’s and I have been told that I have some psychic abilities, mainly psychometry, paranormal, and lately remote viewing. Things come to me in the form of pictures in my mind, feelings and impressions, and sometimes sounds. I typically get them when asked to focus on specific objects or events. I clear my mind, think of the question or object and this blog is an example of what I get. This blog is a way for me to organize all my thoughts. 8:47 PM Today I wanted to do a short response to some questions I recevied on the Zimmerman case. So here they are….

Q. With regards to the Trayvon Martin case. Did it really happened the way Zimmerman said it did. Did Trayvon threw the first punch?

A. I definitely see that Trayvon was uncomfortable… I also get a suspicious vibe. Like Martin didn’t do anything yet, but it was because he felt he was being watched. I’m getting an image of someone working security (undercover security at a department store and watching someone (being Martin) to make sure they don’t steal something. The person watched, doesn’t realize it at first, but they are “lurking around” and not just going from point A to point B. I just see this lingering….

Then there comes a point where Martin realizes that he is being watched… At that point he gets angry. More that his “lingering” got interrupted more than the straight up fact that he was being watched. I see that he (referring to Martin) felt like Zimmerman was a rude interruption to something… exactly like he was rudely interrupted.

Martin got really defensive, and I see him as the first to yell. It was in an irate way. Zimmerman didn’t back down and stood there confidently I see Martin had the chance to leave then, very early on, and he didn’t take it because he was so angry. At this point I start to hear a lot of foul language.. The F word is being used both ways and i hear the phrase “pissed” and “pissed off” with that focusing more on Martin.

Now I see Martin doing some kind of a boxers tip-toe dance and bouncing around. It was like Martin knew there was going to be a fight, and he wanted a chance to have the first punch. Martin wasn’t scared, he was so full of adrenaline My heart is beating hard. Martin was focused.. It does appear that Martin did throw the first punch.

Q. Was the screaming Trayvon’s?

A. As I focus on that I hear Martin’s side yelling, but not making words. Just sounds as they are fighting. More like a growl. It was as if when he exhaled it was a “sound” rather than a breath.

I do see Zimmerman yelling… which leads to the next question that was asked…

Q. Zimmerman’s account does not add up. If he had a gun, why would he be screaming for help?

A. I see he had a gun, but didn’t want to use it. He was screaming trying to get people to help so Martin could be restrained and taken in. I don’t see that he sought out to shoot him. He wanted Martin to realize that he was being watched so if he didn’t intend to do some kind of crime (or tell he friends about a possible crime) that his appearance had been known. I keep flashing back to Wisteria Lane on Desperate Housewives and feel the neighborhood had a closeness about it as Wisteria Lane did, so to yell for help feels right and normal.. I see that Zimmerman carried a gun like an insurance policy, never really thinking he would ever need to use it. Even as he grabbed he was kind of awkward. Like he didn’t make a fluid motion for it.

And those are the questions I have received so far. It is 9:11 PM Link to Audio

""Enough meddling ... Go home, Donald Trump. Get out of Venezuela,"" Maduro yelled in a televised speech. ""Get your dirty hands out of here.""

The socialist leader's condemnation comes a day after the White House imposed sanctions on the chief judge and seven members of Venezuela's Supreme Court. The move was intended as punishment for invalidating the opposition-led Congress earlier this year, a move that was later rescinded.

Maduro's administration has targeted street protesters since November in an attempt to shut down any opposition to his government.

HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT

Mark reports on a secret society

where women act like women

and men behave like men.

Shockingly, they love each other

and are very happy.

















(See Makow Comment below – Satanists attacking basic laws of nature.)





by Mark

(henrymakow.com)

I am one of the very fortunate few because my wife is a stunner, and not just in looks. She’s a real woman and not some money-loving narcissistic career-focused sleep around that many women are. Her idea of a career is being at home looking after her man. She loves to cook, take care of the place, loves my gorgeous german shepherd and they are best friends too.





She loves my family and close friends, hangs about with women who are similar in their ideas (and I get on well with their husbands because they too are real MEN). They don’t all use anti-social media, they meet and talk about nice things, shun violence in films, don’t gossip, and all of them love to wear nice dresses and shoes, nice hair, and make up. They LOOK and ACT like WOMEN.





My wife is still young and has not one single tattoo on her body, no pierced anything. I have never heard her use bad language, and not once have I had a row with her.





She’s not perfect, nobody is, but she’s as close to perfection you can find these days. She’ll also get into the garden and work the plants and flowers while I do all the man work, heavy lifting and other dirty jobs.





(Trendy modern males, aka hipster)





That’s what women really want, a real man and not some confused socially engineered pussy who thinks male anatomy is something he wants inside him. I am self employed and support my wide; she stays at home and takes care of business there. I often receive comments from male friends asking how I found such a lovely person and get asked “does she have a sister?”





I know how fortunate I am to have a loving and caring wife who looks up to her man. I am the head of the house and head of the relationship. Say that to a feminist and you’ll receive a load of vile abusive speech because those idiots have no clue about what being a woman is all about. I take care of my wife and love her so much that no other woman, nobody, could even make me slightly tempted to go astray and sleep with her, not ever!

















IMAGINING MY GAY LIFE





Compare this to life as a gay person. I am not hating gays at all, I just hate what they do and how now they have so many ‘special rights’.

So…I come home to Steve, he gives me a kiss and asks how my day was. There’s no dinner on the table and the home looks almost and feels like a museum becauSe that feminine touch is missing (even though they act or think they act feminine they can’t ever be the same as a woman.) He’s also a career and money driven MAN.





He likely has met up with someone else who wants unsolicited sex today, at least on some phone app to see what’s out there, keeping his ‘options’ open. We are off out later to meet more ‘friends’ who will likely bitch about everything, flirt like crazy with each others partners (maybe even take some of them back home for a group session later on.)





Secretly we feel very empty because we know something isn’t right, something is missing.. that could be the natural desire fighting in the back of our minds, the need for a WOMAN. Then we get to the very unnatural part of our evening and have sex, two males each with the exact same organs and anatomy making love, not able to create anything other than confusion. What is that really all about?





I can’t imagine living with a man (excuse for one) who gets into bed with me at night, says he loves me, and no doubt like most gays sleeps around like crazy and passes on whatever disease from one person to the next. Then I can’t have children, he’s not going to feel the way my wife does about me, never, and I don’t feel that way about him and what a strange future to think that IF it lasts you’ll grow old and gay (and gray) together.





Yep, society with its so-called ‘leaders’ have really screwed up what God put in place, the marriage arrangement of male and female, say that to a lot of people and get a load of abuse, especially from feminists who even if they do believe in God will say it’s not a “he” God is a “She”. Nice one all the leaders of the Illuminati for totally messing up the minds of many.





HOPE FOR SINGLE MEN





There is hope but first you have to be a MAN. You have to stop looking at porn and thinking sex is all there is to a relationship. That’s immediate doom if you want a long lasting and happy relationship. You have to start looking in the right places, not night clubs, dating sites, or slutty MILFS and cougars. You need a good woman with a Christian faith, yes that’s right I said Christian.





Believe me, if a woman follows Bible principles she’ll respect and love you, so long as she’s true to her faith and loves God. God created us all and knows what’s best so if she loves Him and is qualities, she’ll love you, so long as you imitate the qualities of God. Now you’re likely thinking, you need God to get a woman?





Well no, but trust me, my wife is the only woman I have ever known who loved God. Compared to previous partners who said that was stupid and evolution is the answer for life on earth, she’s by far way ahead of them. A Christian woman is humble, loving towards all, especially her man and children, does not care for the things in the world, does not want multiple partners. She does want a long lasting relationship. Show her you are the MAN and can take the lead and you’ll get back a hundred fold of woman.

Makow comment: Mark is describing masculinity and femininity which Mark is describing masculinity and femininity which reflect the fundamental active and passive principles in nature. T he Cabalist Black Magicians are inverting this basic yin yang balance in nature in order to reengineer humanity to be their servants. The Protocols of Zion (16) state: “We will destroy every collective force but our own.” This is how they destroy the nuclear family .





I have downplayed sex but intercourse is central in male-female bonding. Intercourse is the ultimate act of surrender for a woman and possession for a man. Passive- Active = immutable bond. Vaginal orgasm is essential. By encouraging unsatisfying homosexual hook ups and anal intercourse, women are being deprived of orgasms and love by the Satanists who control discourse.

A former member of the S.A.E. (Society of Automotive Engineers), Mark Smyth has had a lifelong love for machinery. Driving a tractor on his family farm at age 4, he raced boats and cars during the 1960s and 1970s, both powered by gasoline and alcohol fuels. Having even used hydrazine (rocket fuel) as a fuel additive in drag racing, Mark learned all about synthetic lubes from a chemist who developed the very first synthetic lube oils to be certified for U.S. military specs back in 1952.

‘Data is the new oil’: Your personal information is now the world’s most valuable commodity

I noticed a few weeks ago when I tried to post a comment under a YouTube video while on my laptop, after I pointed the icon onto the comment section, it showed my full first and last name and that if I posted a comment, that I would be agreeing to setup a YouTube channel. What???

Firstly, why would I want to use my full legal real name if I have never posted a video to YouTube and why is Google trying to sucker me into exposing my full legal name??

The new Ontario home tax for offshore buyers will raise about $150 million for the first 2,000 homes sold. That guesstimate will be mostly one bedroom condos selling for $250,000 and another huge percentage of those 2,000 homes selling in the middle half million dollar range.

That’s at a tax rate of 15 percent based on the selling price. For a two bedroom condo selling for $500,000 that rate will give $75,000 to the government of Ontario and Canada.

I watched the late rebroadcast version of NBC news Monday night with host Lester Holt at an American air base in South Korea.

Oldies are goodies as both the A10 Warthog and the cold war spy U2 plane are both used there and Holt gave us a close report of both.

Great footage from inside the chase car that follows all the takeoffs of the U2 extreme high altitude jet. It has been flying since the 1950s and flies at an altitude of 100,000 feet over North Korea so that the midget dictator cannot shoot it down. That 100,000 feet is 19 miles high.

Polls favorable to Donald Trump may be overestimating his support, state polls suggest

One point that this article fails to mention is that the LA Times poll takes a cross-country read every day from 3,000 people, making it more accurate than most other national polls, that are only one-third the sample size.

And that same LA Times poll mentions that Clinton is ahead by one point, but failed to be honest by reporting a lead for just one day for Clinton in over 8 weeks in the exact same poll.

191,29669,vdare.com,bias,http://www.vdare.com/posts/inauguration-day-riot-j20-new-trials-of-59-may-get-a-new-judge-and-some-jail-time-for-rioters,"I got the following press release from the D.C. USA’s Office after hours, last Thursday:

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia has filed notice with the Court that it is exercising its discretion and moving forward with the prosecution of 59 defendants indicted on felony charges related to the rioting that took place on January 20, 2017, in Washington D.C. The government will be filing motions to dismiss without prejudice the indictment against the other remaining 129 defendants so that it can focus its efforts on this smaller, core group that we believe is most responsible for the destruction and violence that took place on Inauguration Day.

The second (next) set of trials, of

Olivia Alsip

Jashua Barnak

Daniel Meltzer

Gabriel Mielke

Spencer Kaaz

Carlo Piantini

are scheduled to begin on March 5, 2018.

The last scheduled trial, of Michael Loadenthal alone, is planned to begin on October 29, 2018.

If Supervising Judge Lynne Leibovitz presides over the remaining 59 cases, look for most or all of the defendants to be acquitted, and no convicts to do any time. Judge Leibovitz is apparently on a mission to make a mockery of justice. However, Chief Judge Robert Morin is named at the end of the defendants’ list, which sounds like more good news. (I do not know Judge Morin’s history well enough to judge him.)

Judge Leibovitz was so prejudiced in her conduct during the trial that she banned all officers of the court and all witnesses from ever so much as uttering the phrases “Black Bloc” or “ANTIFA” in her courtroom. That order made it impossible for the prosecution to make its case.

Imagine if during the late John Gotti’s various federal trials for racketeering and murder, the judges had forbidden the prosecution from ever uttering “the Mafia,” “Cosa Nostra,” “organized crime,” “Gambino crime family,” “the Don,” or any terms like them? The fix would be in, just as much as if Gotti’s people had bribed a juror.

U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu, and Assistant USAs Jennifer A. Kerkhoff and Rizwan Qureshi, the prosecutors from the Liebovitz trial responded on January 18 with defiance.

GOVERNMENT’S NOTICE OF INTENT TO PROCEED …. On January 20, 2017, several hundred people met in and around Logan Circle in Washington, D.C., to participate in an anti-capitalist march without a parade permit. This unpermitted anti-capitalist march was advertised and planned, with instructions for participants to wear black clothing In addition, the term “black bloc” was used by organizers in planning meetings. The planned use of a black bloc is significant in this case. The term “black bloc” refers to a tactic, not a particular group or organization, and is frequently used when participants within the larger black-bloc group intend to commit violence or destruction of property On January 20, 2017, several hundred people participated in a black bloc as part of the unpermitted anti-capitalist march that started in Logan Circle and moved through downtown DC. At or about 10:19 AM on January 20, 2017, a black bloc moved south from Logan Circle on 13th Street NW. Within minutes of leaving Logan Circle, individuals participating in the black bloc

began to destroy or damage public and private property. The black bloc continued moving through the streets of the District of Columbia for approximately sixteen (16) blocks for more than thirty (30) minutes, while participants in the black bloc continued to destroy or damage property as the group moved. It was a riot. At approximately 10:52 AM on January 20, 2017, after law enforcement formed a police line in the area of 12th and L Streets NW, approximately 200 members of the black bloc charged the police line that was attempting to contain the black bloc in the area of 12th and L Streets NW, Washington, D.C. Although some black bloc participants were able to break through the police line, law enforcement was ultimately able to contain what remained of the black bloc….

Are the powers-that-be using the TV to program us to think infertility and scientific means such as freezing eggs and in vitro are “the new normal”?

Headline: Bitcoin & Blockchain Searches Exceed Trump! Blockchain Stocks Are Next!

I am a mother of four in my mid 30\’s and I have been told that I have some psychic abilities, mainly psychometry, paranormal, and lately remote viewing. Things come to me in the form of pictures in my mind, feelings and impressions, and sometimes sounds. I typically get them when asked to focus on specific objects or events. I clear my mind, think of the question or object and this blog is an example of what I get. This blog is a way for me to organize all my thoughts.

7:25 PM – Hmm….Ok, I am visualizing researchers in a scientific lab, and they are trying to like study the whole fertilization process and trying to determine what genes do what, and I am seeing like this board on the wall. And it will say blue eye, and like have notation beside it, it is not legible to me and written in scientific lingo, and then it will say like brown eyes, blonde hair, like all these different attributes like a person could have. It is a huge list. And they are trying to scientifically figure out how to create humans with certain physical characteristics and intelligence. Then the next thing that I see is a couple and they are in a waiting room in a doctors office, and it is like the guy is holding the woman’s hands and she looks like she has been crying. And my impression is that they are wanting a child, they cannot get pregnant, and they are at that desperation phase. The I see a Dr. take them back and start to explain different fertility options, and then the doctors are handing the couple a menu, like they can custom order their baby. And it feels to me that Dr.’s are preying upon emotions of people who cannot have kids, collecting huge amounts of money for fertility procedures, to fund the bigger picture of studying and learning how to customize babies. I feel like these reality shows are out there to one let people know that all these procedures exist, but secondly, to desensitize you to everything that they are doing. And it is like I am hearing some futuristic slogan of “Why adopt, just customize your baby” or something like that. That is all I initially get.

Q-Why do feel many couples are infertile?

A-I see a person standing…and they have what looks like these waves, like bombarding their body, even going through their body. And it feels like we are so bombarded with electronic or magnetic waves that it pollutes your body. And that is why I feel like when you are younger it is usually easier to get pregnant than when you are older, and that is in part due to the toxin buildup in your body from these waves that are constantly bombarding it.

Q-Do you feel people today actually select their true genetic mates, based off nature, pheromones and a mate that is a compliment to their own DNA? vs. less compatible mates based on other factors.

A-I see that as individualized for the person, so some people yes, and some people no. But the thing that I do see is that people with long lasting relationships that are created from their own free choice, are generally more compatible. The less compatible people I feel have very short lived relationships.

Q-Do you see all babies being test tube babies in the future, and if so how long from now.

A-For the first part, I do NOT see all babies being test tube babies, I feel like the test tube babies are more for the wealthy, or people who are able to come up with the funding for it. I feel like it is going to be in the late 2040′s or early 2050′s, when it is like launched and society starts to accept it. I see there being like a huge controversial thing leading up to it and it will take a while for this to be acceptable, and part of the media now is just to, kind of in small doses, get people familiar with alternative ideas. And I keep feeling there is a huge amount of money to be made in this industry.

Q-Is it motivated by money more than by helping.

A-YES, because I just keep feeling that money part of it.

Q-When does conception start?

A-I keep seeing it as when the first cell divides.

Q-Time frame from when sperm meets egg.

A-I keep seeing 1, it might be 1 minute, but I am leaning towards 1 hour.

Q-Define conception, when soul, spirit, life force, whatever enters the cell. What is it?

A-I see it as a golden light, shooting into the woman’s stomach, and as a cell divides, it starts to glow, and I feel like it is combination of spirit, with universal knowledge..,that nugget…enters the cell right in that moment when it divides.

Q-So with In vitro fertilization, the sperm and egg are combined outside the body, does conception still happen without the woman?

A-Yes, but it is weird, I am getting a picture of a person, and they look like they are catatonic, so I feel like until it is implanted in the woman, like the warmth and personality does not penetrate the embryo. It is like something is not right with the fertilized egg until it is in the woman.

Q-Have children been born, without the use of a mother or surrogate?

A-I am getting no, because you still need the placenta to provide nourishment to the baby, and there is no way to replicate that.

Q-Why can human embryos not be implanted into animal host mothers?

A-It has something to do with their blood, there is some kind of blood exchange or something with the blood that makes it not possible.

Q-Like why can a primate, not carry a human embryo? Is that combination possible?

A-I do not know, I just keep getting something about the blood.

Q-Do we pick our own parents when we incarnate?

A-Hmm..

Q-I do not feel like we pick our own parents, but we pick like the situation, or circumstances we live in…to complete our life lessons and to spiritually evolve. I feel like on the other side of life we all have the same goal, to evolve to the next dimension, but it is unclear to us now in our earthly bodies. But I think that when we die, all of that becomes very clear.

A-Is abortion wrong?

Q-Well there is two sides to it, one that is the individuals choice and they have to live with the decision that they made, but then the second side of it is in some ways I feel it might be fate, that maybe it was soul that jumped in too soon, and it just was not ready to incarnate yet. In some ways it is even a life lesson for the person that is experiencing the abortion because I see a person walking around and it is almost like they are hunch backed, with a big weight on their shoulders and they have to carry that emotional weight of that decision forever. And I feel like maybe that is one of their life lessons during their existence.

Q-Is the US or other countries currently producing “menu” babies?

A-They are not producing now, but there are other countries studying, and on a map I see the central part of Europe lighting up, and also the middle of China lighting up.

Q-Do you see this as a good or bad thing for humanity?

A-As soon as you said that, it wasn’t necessarily good or bad, but I heard the phrase “Is it moral or immoral” and then I see these like wealthy parts of society and everyone looks so similar, I feel like it just takes the randomness out of life. The movie Stepford Wives keeps playing in my head. It is like everybody is so so similar.

Q-Do you have anything else to add, and what is your impression of this reading.

A-I do not have anything else, I think it was a really interesting reading, before this I had never really thought about science going in that direction. As I did the reading I feel uneasy that society could move that way, I feel like it really segregates people, like there is this average population of just like normal folks, and then there is like this elite population of what people define as beautiful people, and it just feels really strange.

Q-I think there was movie called Gattaca with a similar concept, but only the elite could have certain jobs, like there was a lot discrimination, to the natural born.

So I didn’t know (or maybe I kind of knew and was pretending I didn’t) that some cancer cells go hide in your body to come out later as metastases. However, current research has been working on this issue.

“…researchers have discovered the conditions by which specific signals in primary tumors of head and neck and breast cancers can pre-program cancer cells to become dormant and evade chemotherapy after spreading.”

How nice. Or actually how evil! I think it is pretty nasty when cancer cells hide so they can recur and try to kill you. The elude conventional treatments including chemotherapy.

However I think its pretty darn good that finally there is research going on that will help develop new ways to find these evil cells and stop them.



“Recurrence of cancer after initial treatment remains a critical unsolved problem for too many patients,” said William Oh, MD, Chief, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, and Professor of Clinical Cancer Therapeutics at The Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “This highly innovative research provides a novel path forward for targeting dormant cancer cells which may be ‘hiding’ from our available therapies and which may need additional drugs to root them out and improve cure rates.”

In a shocking downside surprise, Richmond Fed’s Manufacturing Survey slumped in January, extending the drop from November’s record high to the biggest 2-month crash since 2006…

From a record-high in Nov 2017, Richmond Fed has collapsed… (the 14 print in January is below the lowest economists’ estimate)

The number of employees and average workweek plunged as expectations for new order volume in 6 months time tumbled to its weakest since before the election…

As good as it gets?

86,14508,nationalreview.com,political,http://www.nationalreview.com/article/427113/after-paris-massacre-debate-closed-isis-poses-special-threat-west-tom-rogan,"For the past 18 months, I and others have repeatedly warned that ISIS posed a special threat to Western nations. We were often accused of scaremongering or warmongering. But then came last Friday. And now that the war has come home — to the streets of a Western city filled with sports fans and music fans and individuals celebrating democratic freedom — the debate is closed.

ISIS is at war with the West. And it must be ended. Of course, in the days ahead some will argue that we should keep “Paris in perspective.” Consider this weekend’s erudite assertions by The Atlantic’s Conor Friedersdorf, who cautions against French retaliation because “ill-chosen wars can and do carry more costs than benefits.” This logic is grossly mistaken. Today, as surely as at Pearl Harbor, the choice of war has been imposed by the enemy.

From the relative sanctuary of its caliphate, ISIS has now invaded the West with arrogant glee. And although some will say that the terrorist threat remains small — that more people are killed by umbrellas than by terrorist attacks — this single attack of terrorism is an onslaught against our societal fabric. By murdering a range of individuals in a range of social settings and in a range of ways, ISIS is cultivating the belief that our lives are insecure.

ISIS is cultivating the belief that our lives are insecure.

However subtle, the gross chilling effect born of this terrorism must not stand. We must annihilate ISIS before it launches new attacks on our way of life. And in France, America now has a capable European ally with which to respond. Although his domestic record is catastrophic , French president François Hollande has proven himself determined in foreign policy, deploying French military forces against al-Qaeda syndicates in Africa and challenging President Obama to take a tougher stance against Iran and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. I expect Hollande will show increasing fortitude in the days ahead.

After all, with his proud people shocked but angered, Hollande will want to bring physical meaning to his statement that these attacks were acts of war. And with the European Union increasingly doubted over economic and sovereignty concerns (see Russia’s invasion of Ukraine), Hollande will see this moment as a test of the EU’s resiliency. Both these considerations lead me to believe that France will significantly escalate its air campaign against ISIS and commence special-forces ground operations against ISIS leaders and infrastructure.

And in this response, France deserves three forms of American support. First, President Obama, who was absent from the Charlie Hebdo memorial, should visit Paris in solidarity. If possible, he should address the French Parliament and offer France U.S. support in the form of escalated military retaliation. Second, he should respond to this attack by energizing a more aggressive and comprehensive campaign against ISIS. Third, President Obama must draw greater attention to allied successes against ISIS. This should include greater publicity (including gun-camera videos) of actions like last week’s air strike on Jihadi John. ISIS leaders and fighters must come to perceive their banner as a magnet for purposeless death, not ordained glory.

We must also challenge ISIS in other unconventional fields, such as satire. After all, while Islamic extremists hate being teased, Muslims attempting to reform political Islam deserve our confidence in free speech. Crucially, we must debate those in our own societies who push the warped delusion that misplaced political correctness can undercut Salafi jihadism.

But as a first step, we must accept the consequence of what occurred on Friday evening in the city of light. One hundred twenty-nine civilians went out that evening in pursuit of happiness and returned home in coffins.

79,13331,washingtonexaminer.com,political,http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/stop-christie-pac-quits-says-candidate-did-its-job-for-them/article/2571009,"A super PAC committed to ending Chris Christie's presidential campaign is calling it quits, claiming the New Jersey governor has done much of their work for them.

Former Rep. Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., created the ""Stop Chris Christie"" PAC last November. Tancredo reportedly said at the time that the group's purpose was to defeat Christie's campaign since the governor is ""no true conservative.""

But in a recent statement posted to the group's Facebook page, treasurer Tom Bjorklund said the group had notified the Federal Election Commission that it would be shutting down the PAC by Sept. 25 due to the ""miserable showing of the candidate in question.""

""Our committee believes that Mr. Christie has already performed the service of stopping his campaign in spirit, (without or aid) even if not by the letter of the law,"" Bjorklund wrote to Laura Sinram, a senior campaign finance analyst at the FEC.

Bjorklund's letter to Sinram was in response to a notification issued by the FEC in July that the group was in violation of federal election rules for using Christie's name without procuring his permission. Two other outside groups associated with Republican hopefuls Carly Fiorina and Donald Trump have also been flagged by the FEC recently for using the candidates' names without their approval.

""Stop Chris Christie""'s website has already been shut down and Bjorklund says they will spend the next couple weeks communicating with vendors and obtaining closing invoices from individuals who assisted with the committee's formation.

According to FEC records, the anti-Christie PAC had only raised $1,350 by the mid-year filing deadline with a total operating expenditure of $8.74.

Christie's popularity has plummeted in his home state where voters have grown increasingly frustrated, claiming that he is prioritizing his presidential run over his responsibilities as governor. The two-term governor barely made it into the first Republican primary debate and, although he is set to take the stage again for the second debate on Sept. 19, recent polls in early primary states place him in the bottom half of the GOP field.

Polling data from RealClearPolitics currently shows Christie averaging 5.3 percent support among Republican primary voters in New Hampshire and just 2 percent in Iowa.

A spokesperson for Christie's camp told the Washington Examiner that the PAC's closure is simply an attempt to dodge an investigation by the FEC.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02

21,3009,awarenessact.com,conspiracy,http://awarenessact.com/6-ways-to-handle-a-psychic-attack/,"Have you ever felt out of place for no apparent reason or as if nothing seemed to be going right? This could mean you are being psychically attacked and you need to know how to combat these things.

If you think negative thoughts or psychic attacks are being pushed onto you then you need to do something about them. While you cannot stop them from happening, you can keep them from controlling your life. These things come from others and are often unintentional. You see, when someone is jealous of you or even doesn’t like you the things they put out into this world have more power than they realize. Below you will find a list of things that can and will help you when these situations arise.

6 Things to Do When You Feel Psychic Attacks Heading Your Way:

This is a pretty popular practice. During meditation imagine a white light at your solar plexus chakra point and allow it to expand ever so gently. With each breath, it will grow brighter. Once it expands beyond the borders of your body you will begin to notice a difference. Think of this as a means of clearing away the negative feelings attacking your body.

This is known as smudging. I suggest using white sage as it is the most easily accessible and will do the job. Cleanse your person and your home. This will rid you of any negativity that may have been lingering.

You can do your own research and figure out which crystals work best for you specifically but for me, black tourmaline works wonders. I carry this in my pocket every single day. Once you get into the swing of carrying crystals you will notice a big change.

4. Enforce healthy boundaries.

If you find these attacks are coming from a specific person limit their presence in your life. No one should be able to hold power over your being. If they are bringing you down cutting them out is essential.

5. Make it clear you will no longer be affected.

Tell yourself verbally that you will no longer let these attacks bother you or affect your life. This is setting your intentions and making it clear that you will not be broken. As mentioned above the things we put out in the world hold more power than we realize.

6. Meditate more often to strengthen your aura.

Meditate as much as you can. Clear your mind and really work to bring a deeper sense of strength to your aura. This is much easier than it sounds.",2018-01-25 16:17:44.789555,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756632,2018-02-02 01:19:41.756664,6 Ways to Handle a Psychic Attack,Gerald Sinclair,,[''],,"energies, negative thoughts, protection, psychic, things, interesting, thoughts, psychic attacks, interest, manifesting, negative energies, steps",,,,,6;

Do you believe the Lord still works through dreams and visions? Bill Salus does. A few months ago Bill awoke in the middle of the night after hearing these words in a dream—The Now Prophecies. Bill was convinced it was a message straight from God. As the thought of going back to sleep crossed his mind, his cell phone rang. It was a call from somewhere in Africa and they didn’t speak a word of English! Wide awake now, Bill took it as a sign and he began writing like he never had before—in complete seclusion for 4 straight months! As things come to a head in the Middle East, the nations of the world seem poised once again for battle. Israel, Russia, Syria, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the USA . . . are we about to see World War 3? Is this the season? Are Psalm 83, Ezekiel 38, Isaiah 17 and Jeremiah 49 about to be fulfilled in rapid fire succession? These are most certainly the NOW Prophecies.

ARE YOU COMPLETELY PREPARED?

IT’S THE MOST IMPORTANT PREP YOU CAN DO !
